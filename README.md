## ✨ Why OpenWA?

**OpenWA** is a free, open-source WhatsApp API Gateway designed for developers who need full control over their messaging infrastructure—without vendor lock-in or hidden paywalls.

Built on a **pluggable architecture**, OpenWA lets you select database engines (SQLite/PostgreSQL), backup/migration storage backends (Local/S3), and cache layers (disabled/Redis) through configuration rather than application-code changes. Message media itself is returned inline to API and webhook consumers; it is not automatically persisted to the storage backend.

| 🔐 **Session-scoped keys**    | Operator and viewer (reader) tokens can be limited to chosen sessions — or all sessions if none are selected                             |
| 🔒 **Chat-scoped keys**       | Those same tokens can also be limited to chosen chats — a few groups and contacts — so an agent on a shared account sees only its own    |

### Session-scoped operator & viewer tokens

When you create or edit an **operator** or **viewer** API key in the dashboard, you can tick the WhatsApp sessions that key may use.

- **No sessions selected** — the key can access every session, including ones created later.
- **One or more sessions selected** — the key can only list, read, and (for operator) manage those sessions. A request naming any other session returns `403` ("API key not authorized for this session"); session-filtered lists (sessions, audit, webhook delivery failures) return that key's rows rather than an error; and the key-management routes and the queue dashboard, which name no session at all, return `403`.

Admin keys stay unscoped in the dashboard so they can keep managing other API keys. The HTTP API still accepts `allowedSessions` on any role if you need that from a client.

### Chat-scoped operator & viewer tokens

A session-scoped key still reaches every chat on the sessions it may use. A key can be narrowed further, to **chats** (a chosen set of groups and individual contacts), with `allowedChats` on `POST /auth/api-keys` or `PUT /auth/api-keys/{id}`. The dashboard sets it on operator and viewer keys (one chat id or phone number per line) and shows each key's chat count in the list.

- **No chats selected** — the key can reach every chat on its sessions.
- **One or more selected** — the key reaches only those chats. Every authenticated REST route not explicitly marked as safe for a chat-scoped key refuses it with `403` (a request naming a session outside `allowedSessions` is refused first, with `403 "API key not authorized for this session"`), including routes added in later releases: the refusal is the default. Inside its chats an operator key can do what the marked routes allow, which is more than reading and sending: it can also delete or clear a chat, leave or rename a group, and block the contact. It cannot change who belongs to a group: adding, removing, promoting or demoting participants, answering join requests and reading or resetting the invite link all stay closed.
- **The two scopes are independent** — a key may be limited to sessions, to chats, to both, or to neither.

This lets you point an **AI agent or third-party integration at a shared account** without handing it every chat. Give the agent a key scoped to the few groups (or DMs) it is meant to handle: it can send and reply there, but it cannot list your other chats, read any other DM, message a contact outside its set, or reach the queue dashboard. It reads its chats' stored messages on either engine through `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/messages?chatId=`, where `chatId` is required for such a key, and live history through `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/messages/{chatId}/history` on whatsapp-web.js only. It receives no pushed events, so it has to poll. It can still read the session's own status (`GET /sessions/{sessionId}`) so an integration can tell whether it is connected.

Identity is matched through the lid mapping table: a contact allowlisted by phone number also matches the same person's `@lid` privacy id once the table maps the two, and an unmapped `@lid` is refused rather than guessed. A lid's digits are never mistaken for a phone number, so `555000111@lid` does not admit `555000111@c.us`.

The default covers REST routes only. Surfaces that authenticate outside the REST guard do not inherit it, so each one that can return chat data refuses a chat-scoped key with its own check: the `/events` WebSocket, the MCP mount (per tool call), and the Bull Board queue dashboard. Four list routes are usable, each filtered to the key's chats before paging: `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/chats`, `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/groups` (id, name and community parent id only), `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/contacts` and `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/labels/{labelId}/chats`.

The API also accepts `allowedChats` on an admin key, but no admin-only route is open to a chat-scoped key, and the last usable admin key cannot be scoped this way.

None of this changes the ban-risk guidance below. It limits what a _key_ can reach, not what WhatsApp makes of the account.

---

## ⚠️ Before you connect a number — please read

OpenWA is an unofficial, community-maintained gateway. It connects to WhatsApp through **reverse-engineered clients** (the [`whatsapp-web.js`](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) project and [`@whiskeysockets/baileys`](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)), **not** through Meta's official Cloud API. This has real consequences you should understand before you link a phone number.

### What this means in practice

- **There is always a non-zero risk of account restriction or ban.** WhatsApp's anti-abuse systems actively look for unofficial automation. No amount of code quality on our side can make that risk zero.
- **Pick the right number.** Never connect your primary personal or business number to an automated gateway. Use a **dedicated number** you can afford to lose. If you're running this for paying clients, pass that guidance on to them.
- **The two engines trade off differently:**

  | Engine            | Ban-risk profile                                                                                        | Resource cost                     |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
  | `whatsapp-web.js` | Lower — drives a real headless Chromium that looks like genuine WhatsApp Web traffic.                   | High RAM (~300–500 MB / session). |
  | `baileys`         | Higher — speaks the multi-device WebSocket protocol directly and is easier for WhatsApp to fingerprint. | Low RAM (~30–80 MB / session).    |

  If account safety is your top priority and you can afford the memory, prefer `whatsapp-web.js`. If you need density and accept the trade-off, use `baileys`.

### Safe-sending guidelines

These are practical guardrails, not guarantees — but they materially reduce the chance of WhatsApp flagging the account:

1. **Warm up fresh numbers.** For the first several days, behave like a normal human user: scan the QR, exchange a handful of messages with saved contacts, join a group or two, set a profile photo. Don't blast on day one.
2. **Don't cold-blast strangers.** Sending the first-ever message to a large batch of numbers that have never messaged you is the single most reliable way to get restricted — on either engine.
3. **Pace sends per session.** Set `SEND_PACING_ENABLED=true` (off by default) for a per-session daily cap: an allowance that grows with the session's age (`SEND_PACING_WARMUP_SCHEDULE`), a separate cap on new conversations (`SEND_PACING_COLD_DAILY_CAP`) and a consecutive-failure breaker; [R002 in the risk guide](docs/16-risk-management.md#r002-user-account-banned) lists what it counts. No per-minute cap is enforced, so spacing within a day is up to the caller: bulk sends wait `delayBetweenMessages` between messages, and single text sends pause behind a typing indicator (`SIMULATE_TYPING`, on by default). A few messages per minute per session is sustainable; "thousands in an hour" is not. The `RATE_LIMIT_*` variables are API abuse protection, counted per route and client IP, not a send cap: they throttle dashboard and read traffic too.
4. **Use opted-in recipients.** The safest workloads are replies and alerts to people who already expect to hear from you (OTP to your own users, order updates, support replies).
5. **Keep a fallback.** For anything auth-critical or revenue-critical, keep an SMS / email / official-Cloud-API path. Do not bet a login flow solely on an unofficial client.
6. **Mind the hosting IP.** Cheap datacenter IPs are flagged more aggressively than residential ones. A residential proxy (supported per-session via the proxy settings) can help; it is not a license to spam.

### Known platform behaviour (not bugs)

A few things that look like bugs but are actually server-side WhatsApp policy, not OpenWA defects — we track them separately so we can distinguish them from real bugs:

- **First message to a brand-new contact sometimes never arrives.** The API returns success because the message leaves OpenWA, but WhatsApp's server-side reach-out / trust policy drops it at delivery. This is independent of OpenWA. We track it in [#830](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA/issues/830).
- **Accounts that get restricted cannot be "unrestricted" by us.** If WhatsApp disables a number, you need to appeal through their channels — OpenWA has no lever to pull.
- **Some accounts cannot link a new device at all.** WhatsApp has added a passkey step to companion linking for some accounts: the phone asks to "Create a passkey" or "Continue on your other device" and the session stays at `qr_ready`. Neither engine implements that step, so switching engine or using a pairing code does not help, and no OpenWA setting changes it. Avoid logging out or re-linking a session that works, since linking it again may hit the same gate, and keep the fallback from rule 5 above. See [the FAQ entry](docs/12-troubleshooting-faq.md#issue-linking-asks-for-a-passkey-and-never-completes-both-engines); tracked in [#560](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA/issues/560).

### Compliance

For any deployment where ethical, legal, or regulatory compliance matters (healthcare, finance, large-scale commercial messaging, anything touching end users in the EU/EEA under DMA/GDPR framings), treat OpenWA as **not approved** and use Meta's [official WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api). OpenWA is an excellent fit for personal projects, internal tooling, automation hobbyists, and learning — it is not a drop-in replacement for the official API in regulated environments.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA.git
cd OpenWA
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Access (the dashboard is bundled into the API image and served on the same port)
# Dashboard: http://localhost:2785
# API: http://localhost:2785/api
# Swagger: http://localhost:2785/api/docs
```

**Your API key.** The first boot generates an admin API key, prints it once in the log and stores it at
`/app/data/.api-key` inside the container. Read it with `docker exec openwa-api cat /app/data/.api-key`,
then use it to sign in to the dashboard and as the `X-API-Key` header wherever this README shows
`YOUR_API_KEY`. Later boots log only a masked prefix. See [API Key](docs/README.md#api-key).

> **Using Podman instead of Docker?**
> Podman rootless mode requires the socket to be running and `DOCKER_HOST` to be set:
>
> ```bash
> systemctl --user start podman.socket
> systemctl --user enable podman.socket
> export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock
> ```
>
> Add the `export` line to your `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent.

### Option B: Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA.git
cd OpenWA

# Install the locked dependencies (includes dashboard)
npm ci

# Start API + Dashboard (config is auto-generated on first run)
npm run dev

# Access (in dev the dashboard runs on the Vite server with hot reload)
# Dashboard: http://localhost:2886
# API: http://localhost:2785/api
# Swagger: http://localhost:2785/api/docs
```

The first boot writes the admin API key to `data/.api-key` (read it with `cat data/.api-key`).

Use `npm install` instead when intentionally changing dependencies. OpenWA's committed lockfile uses
registry artifacts only, so npm 12 works with its secure default that blocks Git dependencies; do not
disable that policy globally.

---

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Docker Socket Proxy

The production stack never exposes `/var/run/docker.sock` directly to the application container. Instead, a dedicated `docker-proxy` sidecar (based on [`tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy)) acts as the sole gateway to the Docker daemon:

```
openwa-api  ──TCP 2375──▶  docker-proxy  ──unix──▶  /var/run/docker.sock
```

Only the operations needed for container orchestration are enabled (`CONTAINERS`, `IMAGES`, `VOLUMES`, `INFO`, `PING`, plus the `POST` method switch). The application connects via the `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-proxy:2375` environment variable, which `DockerService` detects automatically. Note this is an operational gateway, not a fine-grained privilege boundary: with `POST` enabled the proxy admits every method to the enabled paths and cannot scope container-create payloads, so a compromised API container would be host-root-equivalent — see `SECURITY.md` for the full threat model, mitigations, and how to disable the proxy if you don't use the built-in datastore orchestration.

### Non-root Container Execution

The production image never runs the Node.js process as root. On startup, the container follows this chain:

```
dumb-init (PID 1)
  └─ docker-entrypoint.sh (root — fixes named-volume ownership via chown)
       └─ gosu openwa node dist/main  (drops to the openwa user)
```

- **dumb-init** is PID 1 and forwards signals (SIGTERM, etc.) for graceful shutdown.
- **docker-entrypoint.sh** runs as root only long enough to `chown` the named-volume mount points so the `openwa` user can write to them.
- **gosu** performs a clean `exec`-based privilege drop — no `su` or `sudo` wrappers, so the node process is the direct child of dumb-init.

Named volumes (e.g. `openwa-data`) get their ownership corrected automatically on every start, so no manual `chown` step is needed after volume creation.

The image can also start as the `openwa` user directly (uid/gid 997: `--user 997:997`, or the Helm chart's `podSecurityContext`). The entrypoint then skips the `chown` and the `gosu` drop and needs no added capabilities, provided `/app/data` is writable by that uid.

## 🏭 Production Deployment

For production, use the main `docker-compose.yml` with optional services:

```bash
# Basic production (SQLite, local storage)
docker compose up -d

# Also start the PostgreSQL container (configure it first, see below)
docker compose --profile postgres up -d

# Also start PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO (configure them first, see below)
docker compose --profile full up -d
```

| Profile    | Services                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL database                             |
| `redis`    | Redis cache                                     |
| `minio`    | S3-compatible storage (MinIO fork `pgsty/silo`) |
| `full`     | All services above                              |

A profile only starts the container; OpenWA keeps using SQLite and local storage until it is told
to use the new service. The simplest route is **Dashboard > Infrastructure**: pick the built-in
option, save, and restart from there, and OpenWA starts the container itself. The built-in storage
option creates its own `openwa-minio` container, so do not also start the `minio` or `full` profile
for it. The same goes for built-in PostgreSQL and Redis: each built-in option creates its own
container, and the compose profiles are for the manual `.env` route below. The compose `minio`
service starts only once `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are set in the `.env` next to
`docker-compose.yml`; if it was already started without them, run `docker rm -f openwa-minio` before
you enable built-in storage. To use a profile directly, set these in the `.env` next to
`docker-compose.yml` first:

- PostgreSQL: `DATABASE_TYPE=postgres`, `DATABASE_HOST=postgres`, `DATABASE_USERNAME=openwa`,
  `DATABASE_PASSWORD=<strong password>`
- Redis: `REDIS_ENABLED=true`, `REDIS_HOST=redis`
- MinIO: `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`, `S3_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<user>`,
  `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<strong password>`

PostgreSQL refuses to initialize a new volume with an empty password, MinIO refuses to start
without one, and a production boot rejects default credentials such as `openwa` or `minioadmin`.

> The dashboard is bundled into the API image and served by NestJS on the API port, so it
> needs no profile — it is always available wherever `openwa-api` runs. For TLS/public exposure,
> put your own reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer, or a k8s Ingress) in front;
> see the nginx example in `docs/12-troubleshooting-faq.md`.

> **Development vs Production**
>
> - Development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`): SQLite, local storage, API serves the bundled dashboard
> - Production (`docker-compose.yml`): Configurable database, profiles for optional services
>
> Official GHCR images are published as multi-arch manifests for:
>
> - `linux/amd64`
> - `linux/arm64`

To run a published image instead of building from source, add a `docker-compose.override.yml` next to
`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  openwa-api:
    image: ghcr.io/rmyndharis/openwa:latest
```

Run `docker compose pull openwa-api && docker compose up -d --no-build`. To upgrade, update the checkout
first (`git pull`, or `git checkout v<version>` when pinning), then run the same command: the override
replaces only the image, and `docker-compose.yml` forwards an explicit variable list with no `env_file`,
so an outdated copy drops the variables a newer release adds and keeps the old service definitions. Pin a
release by replacing `latest` with its version number. Once the image is pulled, Compose runs it and
builds nothing. The service keeps its `build:` section, so if the pull fails (a mistyped tag, no registry
access) Compose falls back to building from source and tags that build with the published name;
`--no-build` makes that case fail instead. For the same reason, do not use `--build` or
`docker compose build` with this override.

## 📡 API Examples

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your admin key (see [Quick Start](#-quick-start) for where to find it).

### Create a Session

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"name": "my-bot"}'
```

### Start Session & Get QR Code

```bash
# Start the session
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/start \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get QR code (scan with WhatsApp)
curl http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/qr \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Send a Message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/send-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
    "text": "Hello from OpenWA!"
  }'
```

### Setup Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["message.received", "session.status"],
    "secret": "your-hmac-secret"
  }'
```

> **Smart filters (optional):** add a `filters` object to fire the webhook only when conditions match
> (AND), e.g. `{ "conditions": [{ "field": "sender", "operator": "is", "value": ["1234567890@c.us"] }] }`.
> Fields: `sender` / `recipient` / `chatId` / `body` / `type` / `mentions` / `fromMe` / `hasMedia` /
> `isGroup` / `kind`. A webhook with no filters behaves exactly as before. Use `chatId` to allowlist
> specific groups or DMs (e.g. `{ "field": "chatId", "operator": "is", "value": ["120…@g.us"] }`).
> See the API specification for the full schema.

## 🤖 MCP Server (AI Agents)

OpenWA can expose a **curated set of tools over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)** so AI agents (Claude, Cursor, …) can drive WhatsApp. It is **off by default** and **additive** — every REST route keeps working unchanged.

Set `MCP_ENABLED=true` to mount a stateless Streamable-HTTP transport at **`POST /mcp`** on the existing server (same port, no extra process). It mounts **25 read-only tools** by default — session, message, contact, group, webhook, label and automation-rule _reads_ — because the surface is read-only unless you opt out. Add `MCP_READONLY=false` to mount all **51 tools**, adding the write tier (send, reply, group operations). Either way it is a focused surface rather than the full API, so agents aren't overwhelmed.

```bash
MCP_ENABLED=true npm run start:prod   # or set MCP_ENABLED in your .env / compose
```

Point an MCP client at it (e.g. for Claude Code, a `.mcp.json` at your project root):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openwa": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:2785/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

The key can be passed as `Authorization: Bearer …` or `X-API-Key: …`. Every tool call goes through the **same API-key auth, role, and per-session scoping** as REST.

**Security guidance:**

- **Mint a dedicated, least-privilege key** for the agent — a non-admin, **session-scoped** key (`OPERATOR` role at most). The plaintext key is shown only once on creation; to rotate, create a new key and delete the old one.
- The key **must not** carry an IP allow-list (`allowedIps`) — there is no genuine client IP over MCP, so such a key is rejected.
- Set **`MCP_READONLY=true`** to mount only the read tools (no sends/writes).
- Set **`MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`** (default `60`) to limit tool calls per API key per window.
- Set **`MCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`** (default `60000`) to control the sliding window size in milliseconds.
- **Do not expose `/mcp` to the public internet** without a fronting auth proxy. For a self-hosted, locally-reached deployment the static API key is appropriate; public exposure should use OAuth 2.1 (not yet built).
