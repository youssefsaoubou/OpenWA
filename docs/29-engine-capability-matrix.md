# 29 - Engine Capability Matrix

Three-way comparison of every capability: the **Baileys library** (`@whiskeysockets/baileys`
7.0.0-rc14), the **whatsapp-web.js library** (1.34.7), and what **OpenWA actually exposes** through
its adapter layer and REST API — including which "supported" cells only work because OpenWA patches
the installed library. Coverage is total: all 113 `IWhatsAppEngine` methods (29.4), **all 152
Baileys + 81 whatsapp-web.js library methods** (29.5), all 34 + 31 library events (29.5.4), and all
12 install-time patches (29.3). If it exists upstream or in OpenWA, it has a row here.

## 29.1 How to read this matrix

Statuses used in the tables:

- **✅** — works end-to-end through the OpenWA adapter.
- **✅🔧ⁿ** — works end-to-end, but **only because OpenWA patches the installed library** (patch
  `🔧ⁿ`, see 29.3). On a stock, unpatched install of the library this cell would be broken.
- **❌ gap** — _adapter-gap_: the underlying library HAS the capability; only the OpenWA adapter
  wiring is missing. Fixable in this repo.
- **❌ lib** — _library-limitation_: the underlying library exposes no first-class symbol for the
  operation. Not fixable without raw-proto/fork work or an event-cache hack.
- **OpenWA REST** column — what a caller of the REST API gets: **✅** on any engine session,
  **⚠️ `<engine>` only** when the answer depends on the session's engine (the other engine
  answers HTTP 501), **❌ 501** on both engines, and **⚙️ internal** for a method the REST surface
  never exposes: the gateway calls it itself (`probeLiveness`), or no route calls it (`getPhoneNumber`,
  `getPushName`; a caller reads the session's `phone` and `pushName`, stored from the ready event).

Two complementary views:

- **29.4, the OpenWA contract view.** Rows are the 113 `IWhatsAppEngine` methods; use it to see
  what a REST caller gets per engine. Source of truth: `src/engine/engine-capability-matrix.ts`
  (per-cell `evidence` strings cite the exact library `file:symbol` inspected).
- **29.5 — the full engine inventory.** Rows are **every method the installed libraries expose**,
  each mapped to the OpenWA interface method that uses it (or marked unexposed). Use it as the
  implementation backlog: anything `❌ not exposed` with a library symbol behind it is wiring work,
  not research work. 29.5.3 distills the sweetest spot: capabilities **both** libraries already
  have and only OpenWA lacks.

## 29.2 Adapter architecture

OpenWA never calls a WhatsApp library directly from a controller. Every session owns one engine
instance behind the neutral `IWhatsAppEngine` interface (113 methods +
`EngineEventCallbacks`), and all modules go through it:

    BA -.->|"not-available"| E
```

Key adapter facts:

- **Engine is selected once per deployment** by `ENGINE_TYPE` (`whatsapp-web.js` is the default,
  `baileys` the browser-free alternative); every session on the gateway runs the same engine, and
  switching engines needs a restart.
  The REST surface is identical for both; availability differences surface only as 501s, which the
  matrix in 29.4 enumerates.
- **The 501 contract is deliberate.** A capability the engine cannot deliver throws
  `EngineNotSupportedError` (HTTP 501) at the adapter boundary — never a fabricated success, and
  never a stub returning `null`/`[]` that a caller reads as an answer. `engine-parity.spec.ts`
  enforces the biconditional in both directions: a cell is `not-available` if and only if the
  adapter method throws, so a row cannot quietly stop throwing.
- **The two adapters are structured differently.** `WhatsAppWebJsAdapter` methods are thin forwarders to
  delegate modules (`wwebjs-catalog.ts`, `wwebjs-groups.ts`, …), so their throws live in the
  delegates. `BaileysAdapter` throws inline via `this.unsupported(...)`. The drift gate below
  covers both shapes: besides the `Class.prototype.method.toString()` throw-scan it derives a
  throw registry from the `EngineNotSupportedError('method')` / `this.unsupported('method')`
  literals in every adapter and delegate source file (`engine-parity.spec.ts`), so a throw in a
  delegate is machine-checked exactly like an inline one. Two refinements: the literal must be a
  plain single-quoted string naming the refused method (a template-literal or variable-argument
  construction fails the gate outside the one `unsupported()` helper body, as does a literal that
  names no interface method), and a refusal
  that fires only under a runtime condition - `sendTextMessage` with `customPreview` on whatsapp-web.js -
  is pinned in the gate's conditional list instead of flipping the cell, because 'supported with a
  refused option' is not 'not-available'.
- **Inbound events** flow the other way: each adapter normalizes library events into the neutral
  `EngineEventCallbacks` (`onMessage`, `onMessageAck`, `onGroupEvent`, `onCall`, …), which the
  session module turns into OpenWA webhook events. Which library events are consumed — and which
  are dropped — is listed in 29.5.4.
- **Some REST reads bypass the engine entirely.** `GET …/status` reads are served from
  `StatusStoreService` (fed by inbound ingestion on both engines), so status-read parity holds at
  the API level even where the Baileys adapter cells are `❌ lib`. These rows are marked
  `✅ (store) ‡`.

Three automated gates keep the matrix honest:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    M["engine-capability-matrix.ts<br/>rows derived from the interface,<br/>status + evidence from curated exceptions"] --> SPEC["engine-parity.spec.ts<br/>matrix keys match interface methods<br/>throw-invariants scan"]
    NM["node_modules<br/>installed engines"] --> SURF["check-upstream-surface.mjs<br/>npm run test:scripts"]
    SNAP["upstream-surface.snapshot.json<br/>reviewed surface"] --> SURF
    SURF -->|"new or removed symbol"| FAIL["fail until reviewed:<br/>expose / defer / record exclusion"]
    ADAPT["src/engine/adapters/*.ts"] --> INV["engine-inventory-parity.spec.ts<br/>29.5 exposure + 29.5.4 event marks"]
    DOC["this document, 29.5"] --> INV
```

`engine-parity.spec.ts` guarantees every interface method has exactly one matrix row (and vice
versa) and checks the throw-invariants it can observe. `check-upstream-surface.mjs` extracts the
installed libraries' public surface and fails on any drift from the reviewed snapshot, so an
engine bump cannot smuggle in an unreviewed capability **within the surface it reads** — which is
four lists and no more: the `export class Client` block of whatsapp-web.js's `index.d.ts`, its
`Constants.js` event values, Baileys' `lib/Socket/*.d.ts` members and `lib/Types/Events.d.ts`.
Anything upstream outside those is invisible to it, including symbols this page cites as evidence:
`Message.vote` (29.6.1) sits on the `Message` interface, and the `chatModify({mute})`/`({pin})`
shapes in 29.5.3 live in `lib/Types/Chat.d.ts`, which no extractor opens. A version bump whose
extracted surface is unchanged passes with a note, by design — there is nothing new to review.
Neither of those two reads this document — status changes land in the matrix first, then here.

`engine-inventory-parity.spec.ts` is the one gate that **does** read this page, because 29.5's two
right-hand columns are hand-filled and nothing else could see them drift. It asserts that every
symbol marked ✅/⚙️ appears in adapter code rather than only in a comment, that every interface
method named in a ✅ cell is `supported` for that engine in the matrix, and that the ✅ marks in
29.5.4 match the events the adapters actually register. Its limits are deliberate and worth knowing
before trusting a green run: it cannot see **under-mapping** (a ✅ row listing four interface
methods where the symbol really serves eight still passes), it cannot separate a library symbol
from an adapter method of the same name (`logout`), and it cannot see a mapping pointed at the
wrong interface method. Those three remain reader-verified.

## 29.3 Install-time patches OpenWA applies to the libraries

OpenWA ships twelve exact, self-disabling source transforms over the installed engines. Each runs at
`npm install` (`scripts/postinstall.js`, `--best-effort`) and again in the Docker production stage
(**without** best-effort — dependency drift fails the image build). "Self-disabling" means the
patcher no-ops once the fix is present upstream, and an unrecognized source shape fails loudly
rather than shipping a silently partial patch.

"Fails loudly" holds for the image build, not for `npm install`, where `--best-effort` turns a
refusal into one line of a long transcript. So each patcher also exports an `isApplied()` predicate,
its own stand-down branch read back against the installed file, and each engine reports the patches
it is missing as it starts (`src/engine/adapters/engine-patch-status.ts`; 🔧¹ keeps the separate
check described below). The report is diagnostic, not preventive: startup continues, so a session
reaching READY is not evidence that every patch landed. See docs/12 for the operator procedure.

WhatsApp creates the newsletter server-side BEFORE the response is parsed, so each call returned 500 while leaving a real channel behind, and `createChannel` is non-idempotent, so a client retrying a 5xx leaked one orphan per attempt (confirmed on the test account). `description` has the same defect whenever the caller omits one.

Dropping EVERY id left the WA Web request builder an empty repeated field, whose arity assertion threw — the caller saw an unnamed `500` on removal. Promote and demote have no such assertion, so they answered `200` claiming success for people WhatsApp never touched. The patch keeps the resolved array with its holes, skips the call when nothing resolved, and returns `matched` (one boolean per REQUESTED id) so the adapter can report a per-participant outcome instead of inventing one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | exact-shape match; remove once upstream reports which participants it acted on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The replacement helpers `handleBlock`/`handleUnblock` are modal-driven UI wrappers that block nothing when called headless, and the server now refuses a phone-keyed block outright (`trying to block a pn contact without a chat`) because individual chats are keyed by LID while wwjs folds every id back to a phone number.

The first positional argument lands where the object is read, every field comes back undefined, and `widToGroupJid(undefined)` throws inside the page — reaching the caller as a bare `500` while the library still types the method `Promise<boolean>`. `setGroupSubject` in the same module is still positional, which is why subjects kept working and made the Wid look innocent. The patch sends the options object, takes `newDescId` from `WARandomHex.randomHex(8)` as the product does, and maps an empty description to `desc: null` so it selects the job's delete branch rather than sending an empty body element. The open upstream fix #201895 changes the same call, but keeps `WAWebMsgKey.newId()` and passes an empty description through verbatim, so this patcher will not stand down when it lands and the `desc: null` mapping has to be carried over rather than dropped with it. | exact-shape match; unknown shape fails the build.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 🔧¹¹ | `scripts/patch-wwebjs-send-error.js`                       | whatsapp-web.js `Client.js`          | A send the page refused reached OpenWA as the minified `t: t`, with nothing but Node frames: puppeteer rebuilds a page-side exception from its class name and description only, and WhatsApp Web's own error classes are minified to one letter and keep their detail in their own properties. The patch wraps the `window.WWebJS.sendMessage` call inside `Client.sendMessage`'s evaluate. A plain `Error`, which is what whatsapp-web.js's own send failures and WhatsApp Web's `No LID for user` already are, is rethrown as the same object, so its text and OpenWA's matching on it are unchanged. Anything else is rethrown as an `Error` reading `page threw {...}`, a capped JSON summary of the WhatsApp Web build actually running, the constructor name, `name`, `message`, `stack` and the value's own properties. Diagnostic only: a successful send returns what it returned before, and the dead-page classifier never reads a captured error as a transport death.                                                                                                                                                                 | exact-shape match; unknown shape fails the build.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A file the page already decrypted comes from a cache keyed by file hash and skips that check, which is why some downloads kept working. The patch passes `msg.mimetype` to the call, the fix diagnosed in whatsapp-web.js issue #201908 (no release after 1.34.7).

### 29.3.2 Which matrix rows depend on which patch

This is the patch visibility the matrix cells refer to. Every patch is engine-specific (10 on wwjs,
2 on Baileys), and **no row carries a row-level patch mark on both engines**. The two column-wide
patches are a separate matter: 🔧¹ underwrites every wwjs cell and 🔧⁵ every baileys cell, so in
that sense every row does depend on a patch on each side. "Patch-dependent" below means a patch
this row needs specifically, which is usually marked in the row and, for the two that cover a whole
class of rows (🔧⁸ and 🔧¹⁰), stated in the table instead.

| Patch                       | Matrix rows that depend on it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 🔧¹ message-id backport     | **The whole wwjs column** (header-marked, not repeated per row): every wwjs cell that sends, receives or resolves a message id. On unpatched 1.34.7 against WhatsApp Web ≥ 2.3000.x, sends return no message object and chat/media reads throw the minified `r: r`. Not row-specific, so the wwjs column header carries `🔧¹`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🔧² status-send repair      | `postTextStatus`, `postImageStatus`, `postVideoStatus`, `postVoiceStatus` — **wwjs cells only**. Stock 1.34.7 throws before any status send on current WhatsApp Web builds. These four rows are ✅ on both engines, but the wwjs side works only because of this patch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 🔧⁵ app-state resync bound  | No single row — keeps the Baileys socket's app-state resync from spinning (~1000 wasted 60s queries/day). Connection health under **every baileys cell**; the baileys column header carries `🔧⁵`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 🔧⁶ newsletter-create parse | `createChannel` on **baileys** — without it the call always answers 500 and leaks the channel it just created. Row-marked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 🔧⁷ participant arity       | `removeParticipants`, `promoteParticipants`, `demoteParticipants` on **wwjs**. Without it a request naming only non-members throws an arity assertion on removal, and promote/demote answer `200` for people WhatsApp never touched; the patch returns one boolean per REQUESTED id so the adapter reports a real per-participant outcome. Row-marked.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 🔧⁹ group description       | `setGroupDescription` on **wwjs**. Without it every call throws in the page and answers a bare `500`, so the capability is dead rather than degraded; `setGroupSubject` beside it is unaffected. Row-marked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 🔧⁸ block/unblock           | `blockContact`, `unblockContact` on **wwjs**. Without it both answer an opaque `500` on every id, so the capability is dead rather than degraded; the blocklist read still works, which makes the failure look one-sided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 🔧¹⁰ media send repair      | Every **wwjs** media send built by `processMediaData`: `sendImageMessage`, `sendVideoMessage`, `sendAudioMessage` (voice notes included, through `ptt`), `sendDocumentMessage` and the media status posts. A sticker is built by `processStickerData`, which returns a new object rather than the media model. On the WhatsApp Web builds from 2026-09-17 the library's own id is clobbered by the media model and every such send answers a bare `500`, while text sends keep working. Not row-marked: it covers a whole class of rows rather than one. |
| 🔧¹¹ send error capture     | No row. Every **wwjs** send that fails in the page reports what the page threw instead of `t: t`, but no cell's outcome depends on it: a send that works without the patch works the same way with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 🔧¹² download mimetype      | No single row. Every **wwjs** media download goes through `Message#downloadMedia()`: inbound message media (webhook, chat-media archive, the media route), the own-send echo, `getChatHistory` with `includeMedia`, and received statuses. Without it, media the page has not decrypted before arrives as the `omitted` marker instead of its bytes; the messages themselves still arrive.                                                                                                                                                               |

Rows that are ✅ on **both** engines where one side is patch-dependent: `initialize` (🔧⁴ wwjs),
`sendTextMessage` (🔧³ wwjs), `postTextStatus` / `postImageStatus` / `postVideoStatus` /
`postVoiceStatus` (🔧² wwjs), `removeParticipants` / `promoteParticipants` / `demoteParticipants`
(🔧⁷ wwjs), `setGroupDescription` (🔧⁹ wwjs), `blockContact` / `unblockContact` (🔧⁸ wwjs), and
every media send built from the media model (🔧¹⁰ wwjs). The last two carry no mark in the rows
themselves and are recorded in the table above instead: 🔧¹⁰ because it covers a whole class of rows
rather than one, 🔧⁸ simply because its two rows were never marked. Everything else that is ✅-both
carries no patch dependency of its own, but still rests on the column-wide 🔧¹ (wwjs) and 🔧⁵
(baileys), so no row runs on stock library code on both sides.

### 29.3.3 Why no patch surfaces `transferChannelOwnership`'s swallowed reason

`Client.transferChannelOwnership` swallows WhatsApp's own refusal reason —
`contact-not-found-in-newsletter-subscriber-list` — into a bare `false`, so the caller gets a 403
with no cause. A patch to surface it looks obviously worthwhile, and it is not. The counts that
rule it out are below, because the case is attractive enough to be proposed again.

Parsing every `async` method in `Client.js` for a catch that returns `false` finds **five**, all in
the channel cluster. Four of them — `acceptChannelAdminInvite`, `revokeChannelAdminInvite`,
`demoteChannelAdmin`, `deleteChannel` — catch **only** `ServerStatusCodeError` and rethrow everything
else, which is the behaviour we would want and the same shape as `deleteProfilePicture`. The
indiscriminate `catch (ignoredError) { return false; }` appears **once**, in
`transferChannelOwnership` (`Client.js:2627`).

So it is not a house style, and the one method carrying it is the one OpenWA answers 501 for and
never invokes (29.6.2). The patch would repair a path our code does not take. It is also not an
upstream oversight but a deliberate design choice — a boolean return means discarding the cause — so
unlike 🔧⁶ there is no upstream fix that would ever retire it.

One real defect did fall out of that count and is **not** patch-shaped: `deleteChannel`'s page body
opens `if (!channel) return false;` before its try, so its `false` conflates _channel not found_ with
_WhatsApp refused_, and the adapter answers 403 for both. That distinction is ours to make in our own
adapter and involves no library change.

## 29.4 Full capability matrix: the OpenWA contract view (113 methods)

Legend recap: **✅** supported · **✅🔧ⁿ** supported via OpenWA patch `🔧ⁿ` (29.3) ·
**❌ gap** adapter-gap · **❌ lib** library-limitation. Column headers carry the engine-wide
patch dependencies (🔧¹ message-id backport on wwjs; 🔧⁵ app-state bound on
Baileys). The **OpenWA REST** column reads from the caller's side: ✅ works whatever engine the
session runs; ⚠️ depends on the session engine; ❌ 501 on both.

### 29.4.1 Session & connection

| Method               | Baileys adapter 🔧⁵ | wwjs adapter 🔧¹ | OpenWA REST |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `initialize`         | ✅                  | ✅🔧⁴            | ✅          |
| `disconnect`         | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `logout`             | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `destroy`            | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `forceDestroy`       | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `getQRCode`          | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `requestPairingCode` | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `getStatus`          | ✅                  | ✅               | ✅          |
| `probeLiveness`      | ✅ local            | ✅ round trip    | ⚙️ internal |

`probeLiveness` is the one optional member of `IWhatsAppEngine`, and the two adapters answer it to
different depths — which is what the optional marker exists to allow. wwjs races a real
`Client.getState()` round trip against a 10s timeout, because a wedged page keeps reporting
CONNECTED. Baileys returns a local check (`status === READY && sock != null`), because its keepalive
already emits a close event within ~35s. So a wedged wwjs page is caught here; a wedged Baileys
socket is caught by the transport instead. No REST route: the session watchdog polls it.

‡ Status **reads** are served from `StatusStoreService` (fed by inbound status ingestion on both
engines), not by calling the engine — so the REST API is engine-neutral here even though the
Baileys adapter cell is, correctly, `❌ lib`. Calling the Baileys engine method directly still
answers 501.

| `subscribeToPresence` | ✅                  | ❌ lib           | ⚠️ baileys only |
| `rejectCall`          | ✅                  | ❌ lib           | ⚠️ baileys only |

**Totals:** 113 methods → 226 adapter cells: **199 ✅, 27 ❌** (2 adapter-gaps, 25
library-limitations, 0 uncertain) across 26 methods. From the REST caller's side: **89** methods
work on any engine (87 fully supported + 2 store-backed status reads), **14** are Baileys-only,
**9** are wwjs-only (the 2 store-backed rows excluded); `sendCatalog`, unavailable on both engines,
is not exposed. Three of the 89 (`probeLiveness`, `getPhoneNumber`, `getPushName`) are ⚙️ internal and
have no route.

## 29.5 Full engine method inventory — every library method, mapped to OpenWA

This is the backlog view: **all 152 Baileys socket methods and all 81 whatsapp-web.js Client
methods**, each marked with where OpenWA uses it. The symbol list itself is gated:
`check-upstream-surface.mjs` extracts the installed libraries' public surface and fails on any
drift from `scripts/upstream-surface.snapshot.json`, so a library bump forces a review of this
section. The exposure mapping is hand-maintained against the adapter sources
(`src/engine/adapters/*.ts`), and partly gated: `engine-inventory-parity.spec.ts` fails when a
✅/⚙️ symbol exists only in a comment, when a ✅ cell names a method the matrix calls unavailable,
or when a 29.5.4 ✅ has no listener behind it. It does **not** check that a ✅ row lists every
interface method the symbol serves — see 29.2 for what stays reader-verified.

Exposure column values:

- **✅ `<InterfaceMethod>`** — the adapter wires this library symbol inside these
  `IWhatsAppEngine` methods.
- **⚙️ internal wiring** — referenced in `src/` but not inside any interface-method body (event
  wiring, health probes, helpers).
- **🔩 plumbing** — E2EE/socket/media-transport internals that are adapter machinery, not user
  capabilities; correctly never exposed.
- **❌ not exposed** — a real library capability with no OpenWA path. **This is the implementation
  backlog.**

with zero OpenWA surface. Baileys-only; whatsapp-web.js has no community API at all.

### 29.5.3 Supported by BOTH libraries — missing only in OpenWA

**Empty.** No capability has a first-class symbol on both engines and no `IWhatsAppEngine` method.

A row belongs here when both libraries expose a symbol for the same capability and the interface
has no method for it, because one new interface method then wires both adapters at once.

⚠️ **A symbol in `.d.ts` is not evidence the call works.** `createGroup`, `demoteChannelAdmin`,
`transferChannelOwnership` and `rejectCall` each have a typed method on whatsapp-web.js (a `Client`
method, or `Call.reject()` for `rejectCall`), and each fails against live WhatsApp Web: all four
are `not-available` there and detailed in 29.6.2. Add a row here from the typings; do not mark its
cell `supported` until a live call has returned WhatsApp's own answer.

Near-misses (both libraries have the area, but the symbol sets only partially overlap — still
worth an interface method): **channel admin invites** (wwjs
`sendChannelAdminInvite`/`acceptChannelAdminInvite`/`revokeChannelAdminInvite`; Baileys has no
invite-symbol counterpart), **message search** (wwjs `searchMessages`; Baileys has no server-side
search — would be store-backed), **poll-vote read** (wwjs `getPollVotes`; Baileys inbound-only via
`decryptPollVote`).

### 29.5.4 Events inventory — all 34 Baileys + 31 wwjs events

OpenWA consumes events by normalizing them into `EngineEventCallbacks`; anything else is dropped.
"Consumed" below means referenced by the adapter code.

| `getChatsByLabel`       | lib   | Same; listing a label's chats needs an app-state cache fed by label-association sync events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `getChatHistory`        | lib   | Only `fetchMessageHistory(count, oldestKey, oldestTs)` (`Socket/business.d.ts:25`), which returns a sync-token _string_; messages arrive later via the `messaging-history.set` event. No synchronous per-chat `fetchMessages`.                                                                                                                           |
| `getMessageReactions`   | lib   | No on-demand fetch; reactions exist only as event-augmented `WAMessage.reactions` via the `messages.reaction` event, and the adapter does not persist them into its store. Inbound reaction _events_ (`onMessageReaction`) work fine — only the read-back is unavailable.                                                                                |
| `getContactStatus`      | lib   | `fetchStatus` (`Socket/chats.d.ts:42`, via `USyncStatusProtocol`) returns the _about/profile text_ line, not 24h stories. Stories surface only as `status@broadcast` messages. REST reads are store-backed — see ‡ above.                                                                                                                                |
| `getContactStatuses`    | lib   | Same as above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `sendCatalog`           | lib   | `AnyMessageContent` (`Types/Message.d.ts:166-210`) has only `{product}` (single product); the catalog CRUD nodes (`Socket/business.js:294-362`) mutate the catalog, they don't send it.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `votePoll`              | lib   | No vote-send helper at all; the library only _decrypts incoming_ votes (`decryptPollVote`). Sending needs a hand-built `proto.Message.PollUpdateMessage` with HMAC-SHA256 encryption keyed by the poll creation's `messageSecret`.                                                                                                                       |

| `subscribeToChannel`       | gap   | `Client.subscribeToChannel(channelId)` (`Client.js:2542`) takes a channel **id** and resolves a boolean — it cannot satisfy the subscribe-by-invite-code contract alone. Correct wiring is two-step: `getChannelByInviteCode(inviteCode)` (`Client.js:1716`) → `subscribeToChannel(channel.id)`, unverified against a live session (the previous one-step call was a phantom success). The one remaining wwjs adapter-gap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `createGroup`              | lib   | `Client.createGroup` exists and is typed `Promise<CreateGroupResult \| string>`, but its injected evaluate reaches a WhatsApp Web internal that no longer exposes `findImpl` (`Client.js:2325`). Measured live on **two** builds — `2.3000.1044858477-alpha` auto-resolved and `2.3000.1044770897-alpha` pinned — both `TypeError: this.findImpl is not a function`, reaching the caller as a bare 500. Bare and `@c.us`-qualified participant ids fail identically, so the id shape is not the variable; varying the build is what separates this from registry pin drift. `findImpl` is in neither the installed `Client.js` nor any OpenWA patcher, so it belongs to the page and cannot be patched around. Baileys serves this capability. |
| `demoteChannelAdmin`       | lib   | `Client.demoteChannelAdmin` exists (`index.d.ts:35`) but its page body calls `window.require('WAWebDemoteNewsletterAdminAction').demoteNewsletterAdmin` (`Client.js:1907-1925`), and a module probe on a live session (Web `2.3000.1044824727-alpha`, unpinned) returned that module resolving with `demoteNewsletterAdmin: undefined`. The sibling path used inside `transferChannelOwnership` (`WAWebNewsletterDemoteAdminJob.demoteNewsletterAdminAction`) is undefined too, so there is nothing to retarget. Baileys serves this capability.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `transferChannelOwnership` | lib   | `Client.transferChannelOwnership` exists (`index.d.ts:375`) and its page function `WAWebChangeNewsletterOwnerAction.changeNewsletterOwnerAction` is present, but on Web `2.3000.1044824727-alpha` it rejects every call **locally** with `contact-not-found-in-newsletter-subscriber-list` — 4-9ms against a 352-531ms known-server baseline measured in the same page, so it never reaches WhatsApp. Unchanged by subscribing the target, promoting it to admin, or restarting the session; the only repopulation path, `WAWebCollections.NewsletterMetadataCollection.update`, is `undefined`. Baileys serves this capability.                                                                                                               |
| `upsertLabel`              | lib   | 1.34.7 reads labels and assigns them (`getLabels`, `getLabelById`, `getChatLabels`, `getChatsByLabelId`, `addOrRemoveLabels`, `index.d.ts:129-154`) but exposes nothing that creates/edits a label definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `subscribeToPresence`      | lib   | Only `sendPresenceAvailable`/`sendPresenceUnavailable` (`index.d.ts:230,233`), which publish the _account's own_ presence; no subscribe call and no presence event is emitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `rejectCall`               | lib   | `Call.reject()` exists and is typed `Promise<void>` (`index.d.ts:2417`), but measured live on 2026-09-17 on OpenWA 0.23.4 with WhatsApp Web `2.3000.1047471845-alpha` the reject resolved and OpenWA logged the call as auto-rejected while the caller's phone kept ringing until it timed out. The cause is not established. The page function it runs, `WWebJS.rejectCall`, is modified by OpenWA patch 🔧¹ (`wwebjs-201832`), which reads the own user id from `getMaybeMePnUser()._serialized` or `$1`. Baileys serves this capability, and its auto-reject stopped the caller's phone at once in a live test the same day.                                                                                                                |

## 29.7 Caveats on supported rows

✅ means works end-to-end — but these rows carry behavioral differences worth knowing:

- **`clickButton` (Baileys), native-flow is unverified.** Classic `buttonsMessage` /
  `templateMessage` / `listMessage` prompts go through Baileys' `buttonReply` / `listReply`
  helpers. A native-flow `interactiveMessage` prompt is answered with the same template
  `buttonReply` shape; Baileys also has `InteractiveResponseMessage.nativeFlowResponseMessage`,
  which this adapter does not construct. Until a live business native-flow prompt confirms
  what the server accepts, do not treat that arm as fully supported. URL/call CTAs are omitted
  from inbound `buttons[]` and cannot be clicked.
- **`postTextStatus` / `postImageStatus` / `postVideoStatus` / `postVoiceStatus` (wwjs).**
  whatsapp-web.js has no status-recipient argument, so `StatusPostOptions.recipients` is **not
  honored** — the post broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience (a one-time warning is
  logged). All four go through the same warning (`wwebjs-status.ts`: `postTextStatus` directly, the
  other three via `postMediaStatus`). The Baileys engine honors `recipients` (`statusJidList`). The
  wwjs cells also depend on patch 🔧² (29.3.2).
- **Media sends to a channel JID (wwjs) answer 501.** `sendImageMessage`, `sendVideoMessage`,
  `sendAudioMessage`, `sendDocumentMessage` and `sendStickerMessage` are ✅ on wwjs for chats and
  groups, but a `<id>@newsletter` recipient throws `ChannelMediaNotSupportedError` (a
  `NotImplementedException` → HTTP 501) at `ensureNotChannelRecipient` (`wwebjs-messaging.ts`, in
  `sendMediaMessage` for the media funnel and in `sendStickerMessage` for stickers). whatsapp-web.js
  calls `msg.avParams()`, removed in a recent WA Web build (upstream wwebjs#201823, unresolved).
  Unquoted text→channel is unaffected, and Baileys has no such restriction, so these five rows answer
  `501` without a per-row ❌ in 29.4. A few other sends answer `501` on wwjs by recipient, because
  whatsapp-web.js drops them without touching the page (`Client.js` `sendMessage` returns `null`): a
  reply (any send carrying a quoted message), a location or a contact card to a channel,
  `status@broadcast` or a broadcast list, and a poll or a sticker to `status@broadcast` or a
  broadcast list. `ensureSendable` (`wwebjs-messaging.ts`) refuses them before the library is
  called, so nothing is sent. The Baileys adapter refuses none of them.
- **`sendStickerMessage` — what each engine converts.** Both engines guarantee the payload really is
  WebP, but they reach it differently and they do not accept the same inputs. whatsapp-web.js passes
  `sendMediaAsSticker: true`, and `Util.formatToWebpSticker` converts `image/*` **and** `video/*`
  (the latter via ffmpeg), rejecting anything else with `Invalid media format`. Baileys stamps
  `image/webp` on the payload unconditionally and transcodes nothing
  (`prepareWAMessageMedia` → `MIMETYPE_MAP.sticker`), so the adapter converts before the socket:
  WebP passes through byte-identical (preserving its sticker-pack EXIF), other `image/*` input is
  re-encoded to a 512×512 WebP with animation retained, and everything else — **including
  `video/*`** — is refused with a `400`. So an animated-video sticker works on wwjs and answers
  `400` on Baileys. ffmpeg is deliberately not wired in on the Baileys side: the binary ships only
  in the Docker image, so depending on it would make the same request succeed or fail depending on
  how the gateway was installed.
- **`deleteStatus` (baileys).** Baileys sends a status stanza, the revoke included, to exactly its
  `statusJidList`, so the revoke is addressed to the recipients the adapter remembered when it posted
  the status. It keeps them in memory for 24 hours, so a status this session did not post in the last
  24 hours (one posted from the phone or from another node, or before the session's engine was last
  created: a process restart, a session stop and start, or a reconnect the gateway runs itself, such
  as after a failed liveness check) is refused with `403` (`EngineRefusedError`) instead of a revoke
  that reaches nobody while the status stays up. The transient reconnects Baileys runs on its own keep
  the same engine, and the list with it.
  The `sendMessage(status@broadcast, {delete})` revoke shape is _empirically unverified_: only posting
  was live-spiked. On wwjs it calls `revokeStatusMessage(statusId)` (own status only).
- **`getChats` after a restart (baileys).** Baileys keeps no chat list of its own, and WhatsApp
  skips history sync on every connect after the first link, so a new engine (a process restart, a
  session stop and start, or a reconnect the gateway runs itself, as for `deleteStatus` above) starts
  with an empty one. `GET /chats` then lists the groups, re-fetched on every connect, and every chat
  with a persisted archive, pin or mute state (bounded by `BAILEYS_CHAT_STATE_CACHE_MAX`); any other
  1:1 chat comes back when its next message arrives and stays out of the list until then. Rows
  rebuilt this way carry timestamp `0` and no `lastMessage` until a message arrives. The transient
  reconnects Baileys runs on its own keep the list. whatsapp-web.js reads WhatsApp Web's own chat
  list and is unaffected.
- **`getContactStatus` / `getContactStatuses` (wwjs).** `Status.type` is the `text|image|video`
  union — audio/other story types collapse to `text`.
- **`archiveChat` / `clearChatMessages` / `deleteChat` / `sendSeen` / `markUnread` (baileys).** The
  four `chatModify` actions (archive, clear, delete, unread) need the chat's last known message, which
  the patch carries. `sendSeen` without message ids is `readMessages([key])` for the newest _received_
  (not `fromMe`) message, since Baileys drops own keys from a receipt. A chat with no such message
  resolves `false` rather than throwing, so a chat the session has seen no message in, or one holding
  only this account's own sends, answers `POST chats/read` with `{"success": false}`, where
  whatsapp-web.js marks it read from the page-side chat object without needing any local history.
- **`setProfileName` / `setProfilePicture` / `deleteProfilePicture` refusals (baileys).**
  whatsapp-web.js reads a page-side verdict for all three (`setDisplayName` and `setProfilePicture`
  resolve `false`, `deleteProfilePicture` resolves an explicit `false`) and raises a `403`. The
  Baileys calls resolve with no acceptance signal, so a change WhatsApp declined answers `200`. Only
  `setProfileStatus` is symmetric: neither engine surfaces a refusal for it.
- **`editMessage` / `pinMessage` / `unpinMessage` refusals (baileys).** Both engines refuse what they
  can judge locally: the target must be addressable inside the given chat, and the Baileys adapter
  additionally refuses an edit of a message the account did not send. Past those guards they diverge.
  whatsapp-web.js reads a page-side verdict (`message.edit()` resolves `null`, `message.pin()`
  resolves `false`) and raises a `403`; Baileys sends the edit or pin as an ordinary protocol message
  and is never told the outcome. So a pin refused because the account is not a group admin, or an
  edit refused because the target is not a text message, answers `403` on whatsapp-web.js and `200`
  on Baileys.
- **`muteChat` addressing.** whatsapp-web.js resolves the chat before writing and answers `400` for a
  chatId it cannot resolve; Baileys writes the app-state patch without a lookup and answers `200` for
  a chat that does not exist. `pinChat` splits the same way.
- **`getChannelById` reach and payload.** Baileys resolves any channel by JID
  (`newsletterMetadata('jid', …)`), including one the account does not follow. whatsapp-web.js 1.34.x
  exposes no per-id lookup, so the adapter scans the subscribed-channel list and returns `null` (a
  `404`) for every channel the account is not subscribed to. The `Channel` payload differs too:
  Baileys reads `createdAt` off the newsletter metadata and whatsapp-web.js never fills it. Neither
  engine fills `picture`: WhatsApp reports the channel picture as a media path, not a URL.
- **`starMessage` (baileys).** Needs the stored key's `fromMe` — the same id means different
  messages depending on direction.
- **`addParticipants` result shape.** wwjs returns a per-participant `{code,message}` object or a
  batch refusal string; Baileys returns per-jid `[{status}]`. Both are mapped onto the HTTP
  `results` field; a total refusal throws.
- **`setGroupMemberAddMode` read side.** The engines disagree (Baileys boolean
  `memberAddMode`, wwjs raw WhatsApp strings — and wwjs's own type declares the opposite sense);
  both are normalized to `'all'|'admins'` at the adapter.
- **`deleteContact` addressing.** wwjs addresses by phone number
  (`deleteAddressbookContact`), Baileys by JID (`removeContact`) — the adapter converts.
- **`deleteMessage` (baileys, `forEveryone=false`).** Wired via `chatModify({deleteForMe})`.
  `forEveryone=true` on a message the account cannot revoke (not its own, and not in a group it
  administers) falls back to that same delete-for-me, as whatsapp-web.js does. WhatsApp ignores such
  a revoke while the send still resolves, so sending it would report a deletion that never happened.
  When the group's member list shows no row the gateway can identify as the account, admin status is
  unknown and the revoke is still sent.

## 29.8 Snapshot summary

Recomputed from `engine-capability-matrix.ts`, `upstream-surface.snapshot.json`, and a scan of the
adapter sources — re-derive the same way when anything changes:

- **113** interface methods → **226** adapter cells: **199 ✅** / **27 ❌** (2 adapter-gaps, 25
  library-limitations, 0 uncertain), spanning **26** methods.
- Of the 199 ✅ cells, **10 wwjs cells carry an explicit patch dependency** (4 × 🔧² status send,
  1 × 🔧³ channel link preview, 1 × 🔧⁴ ready-sync, 3 × 🔧⁷ participant arity, 1 × 🔧⁹ group
  description) and one baileys cell
  does (1 × 🔧⁶ newsletter-create parse); the whole wwjs column additionally
  depends on 🔧¹, the whole Baileys column on 🔧⁵ — so every row rests on a patch on each side,
  even though no row carries a row-level mark on both.
- REST caller's view: **89** engine-neutral (87 + 2 store-backed status reads), **14** Baileys-only,
  **9** wwjs-only; `sendCatalog` (unavailable on both engines) is not exposed; three of the 89
  (`probeLiveness`, `getPhoneNumber`, `getPushName`) are ⚙️ internal and have no route.
- Full engine inventory (29.5), split by the exposure legend rather than lumped: Baileys **152**
  socket methods — 48 wired into interface methods, 5 internal wiring, 29 plumbing, **70 ❌ not
  exposed** (incl. the whole 23-method community cluster); wwjs **81** Client methods — 41 wired,
  4 internal wiring, 1 class plumbing, **35 ❌ not exposed** (27 real capabilities + 8
  session/transport settings that are not WhatsApp capabilities). The backlog is the ❌ rows minus
  those 8 settings; 🔩 plumbing is correctly never exposed.
- Events: Baileys **34** (17 consumed / 17 dropped), wwjs **31** (16 consumed / 15 dropped).
- **0** capabilities in 29.5.3: every capability with first-class symbols on both libraries is
  either wired or classified with evidence. Some are Baileys-only despite typed whatsapp-web.js
  symbols: `createGroup`, whose injected evaluate reaches a page internal without `findImpl`;
  `demoteChannelAdmin`, whose page function WhatsApp Web no longer provides;
  `transferChannelOwnership`, whose page function rejects locally against a subscriber list it
  cannot repopulate; and `rejectCall`, whose `Call.reject()` resolves while the caller's phone
  keeps ringing (all in 29.6.2). Each answers 501 on wwjs. `.d.ts` presence is not capability, and
  only a live call distinguishes the two.
- **12** install-time patches (10 whatsapp-web.js + 2 Baileys), all exact and self-disabling.
- **0 phantom-support rows** — every `not-available` cell throws at the adapter boundary.
- Remaining adapter-gaps (fixable in this repo, ranked): **#1** `getChannelMessages` (Baileys —
  fetch is one line, `BinaryNode`→`ChannelMessage` parser is the work); **#2** `subscribeToChannel`
