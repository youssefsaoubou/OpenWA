## 25.1 What it is

The **Integration Fabric** is a core substrate that lets sandboxed marketplace plugins implement
bidirectional integrations with external systems — helpdesk agent inboxes, chatbot flow builders, CRMs —
**without running their own server**. A third party ships an adapter as a normal marketplace plugin,
declares its needs in the manifest, and never binds a port, never touches Redis or the queue, and never
re-implements signature verification, deduplication, ordering, or delivery.

It is the inbound counterpart to the existing plugin capability surface. Today a sandboxed plugin is
outbound-only: it can send messages, read engine state, use per-plugin storage, and make SSRF-guarded
HTTP calls (`ctx.net.fetch`). What it **cannot** do is receive an inbound external HTTP request — and a
real bidirectional integration needs exactly that: an agent replies in an external inbox, the external
system fires a webhook, and something must receive it and relay the reply to WhatsApp.

The core owns ingress, verification, dedup, ordering, delivery, the dead-letter queue, secret storage,
and the identity-mapping table. The adapter owns only provider-specific logic (API calls, HMAC recompute
for exotic schemes, handover heuristics). Plugins consume the substrate through a **stable, versioned
public contract — Integration SDK v1** — because the contract, not any single adapter, is the product.

## 25.2 Design principle: one new primitive, everything else a clone

The overriding goal is to preserve the sandboxed-worker safety invariants _by construction_. OpenWA
plugins reach the host through a capability-gated worker bridge; the worker is fault containment, not a
security boundary against a malicious plugin (see [30 - Plugin Sandboxing](./30-plugin-sandboxing.md)).
Every host↔worker message is a serializable POJO across a `structuredClone` boundary; host-initiated
calls are bounded by a timeout and drain on a worker crash (a hook fails open; an ingress dispatch fails
the delivery); permissions are manifest-static and cannot be widened by configuration; session scope is
enforced host-side.

Rather than invent new machinery that would have to re-earn those properties, the Integration Fabric is
**~90% a faithful clone of seams OpenWA already ships**:

| Concern                                                   | Cloned from                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Host→worker dispatch with a bounded timeout + crash-drain | the existing hook bridge            |
| Worker→host capability calls                              | the existing capability router      |
| Durable delivery with retry + dead-letter                 | the outbound webhook queue and DLQ  |
| Identity mapping table (no foreign key, last-write-wins)  | the LID↔phone mapping table         |
| Inbound deduplication (insert-or-skip on a unique key)    | the inbound-message dedup oracle    |
| SSRF-guarded egress                                       | `ctx.net.fetch` (reused verbatim)   |
| Secret masking on read                                    | the plugin config redaction utility |

Exactly **one** genuinely new primitive exists: a host→worker RPC that returns an **HTTP status + body**
from a sandboxed worker — inbound webhook ingress. It is modelled line-for-line on the hook bridge so its
correctness properties (its own pending map, a bounded timeout, and a drain in the worker-exit handler)
come for free. A timeout resolves `504` and a mid-dispatch crash resolves `502`; the ingress job treats
either as a failed delivery and retries or dead-letters it.

The topology is intentionally two-tier (an n8n-style queue mode): an **ingress tier** (the public
controller: authenticate → normalize → persist → enqueue → fast `202`) decoupled by a durable queue from
a **dispatch tier** (the processor that runs the plugin). A provider spike, a slow adapter, or a wedged
plugin never loses events; the tiers scale independently with backpressure.

Alongside this async pipeline, a route may additionally declare a `response` contract — host-side
`preflight` checks and a declarative `ack` — that shapes the synchronous HTTP response the provider sees
**without** altering the dispatch model. The plugin still always runs async (enqueued, full DLQ/retry);
`response` only controls what the provider receives back on the request socket. See §25.4 and §25.8.

## 25.4 Core components

- **Ingress RPC** — the one new primitive. Delivers a verified inbound request into the worker and returns
  its HTTP result. The worker claims routes with `ctx.registerWebhook(route, handler)`.
- **Ingress controller** — a `@Public` endpoint accepting any HTTP method on
  `/api/ingress/:pluginId/:instanceId/:route` (a `GET` on a route that declares `challenge` is answered
  host-side as the verification handshake; every other request is a delivery). It is public to the
  API-key guard because an external provider cannot present the gateway's API key, so it self-validates
  (see §25.6). It never runs the plugin inline — providers enforce short acknowledgement
  deadlines, so the controller fast-acks and defers the work to the queue. A route may additionally
  declare a host-side `response` contract that shapes that synchronous reply without making the plugin
  inline. Its `preflight` checks (today: `session-alive`) run **after** signature verification and
  **before** the dedup persist — returning `503` only for a definitively-dead concrete-scoped WhatsApp
  session (no live engine or `FAILED`), with a `Retry-After` so a provider that retries a 503 only when
  that header is present comes back; recoverable statuses and `READY` pass through to a normal
  `202`+enqueue so the worker can still fail fast and the dedup row still holds the delivery. A declared
  `ack` (`status`/`body`/`headers`) replaces the default `202 accepted`. For a route declaring `response`,
  the ack is returned without awaiting enqueue so a queue-disabled deployment cannot block the provider's
  deadline; the dedup row already persisted is the durability handle. A route with no `response` is
  byte-identical to today's default fast-ack.
- **Plugin instance** — a first-class `instanceId` namespaced under a `pluginId`. One adapter can back
  many instances (for example, one external account per WhatsApp number). Each instance owns a host-minted
  ingress secret, a resolved session scope, and a config slice. It is a serializable field threaded
  through payloads and rows — **not** a separate worker; there is still one worker per plugin.
  _Known residue:_ per-instance isolation covers the **ingress dispatch** path (concrete-scoped
  instances resolve their own config slice). A `wildcard`/`null`-scoped sibling is still projected
  into the plugin's **base** config with last-write-wins merging, so a sparse wildcard instance
  inherits keys a sibling projected, and hook dispatch resolves config without per-instance
  scoping. Run one enabled wildcard instance per plugin, or scope instances concretely, until the
  projection is re-keyed per instance. Capability calls are not confined to the dispatching instance's
  scope either: separating tenants across instances of one plugin relies on the handler using the
  delivery's `sessionId`.
- **`conversation.send` capability** — a normalized outbound send authored by the plugin and translated
  host-side to the message service, so persistence and the message hook chain are preserved. It is gated
  by a `conversation:send` permission, the manifest's session scope and, for a session-scoped plugin, its
  activated sessions.
- **Identity, dedup, and DLQ tables** — see §25.5.
- **Ingress queue** — a durable BullMQ queue that is a _sibling_ of the outbound webhook queue (its own
  worker, not the reordering webhook worker), with exponential-backoff retries and a dead-letter row on
  the final attempt. When that row cannot be written (a data-database outage), the delivery is re-queued
  under a new job id and runs again after 60s with the same retries; a re-queued copy that fails again
  adds no second row while one is open.

## 25.5 Data model

Four tables live on the data connection, each created by a hand-authored dual-dialect migration
(SQLite and PostgreSQL):

- **`plugin_instances`** — one configured instance of an adapter: its host-minted secret (masked on read),
  resolved session scope, and config.
- **`conversation_mappings`** — the WhatsApp-chat ↔ external-conversation identity map, indexed in both
  directions, plus a `handoverState` column (`bot | human | closed`) the core reads before dispatching so
  a human-handled conversation deterministically stops the bot. `sessionId` is non-foreign-key provenance
  because a mapping outlives a session.
- **`ingress_events`** — the persist-before-acknowledge row and the inbound deduplication oracle
  (`UNIQUE(pluginId, instanceId, providerDeliveryId)`, insert-or-skip). It also carries the dispatch-lifecycle
  markers the reconciler sweeps on: `dispatchState` (`pending | dispatched | failed`, `NULL` on rows
  that predate the columns on a synchronize-bootstrapped DB — "not watched"), `dispatchAttempts`, and
  `lastDispatchAt`. New rows are `pending`; a recorded enqueue outcome flips them to `dispatched`;
  `failed` is terminal (recovery continues via the DLQ row + redrive), except that a re-queued copy
  (see §25.4) that delivers moves the event to `dispatched` and retires the delivery's open DLQ row.
  The row carries the **full request payload only while it is the sole durability handle** — from the
  persist until the dispatch outcome is recorded. Once the dispatch tier owns the delivery (the BullMQ
  job data, or the DLQ row on failure), the payload is retired to `NULL` and the row slims to its
  dedup marker plus `payloadHash` (a sha256 of the raw body kept for operator correlation). This keeps
  steady-state growth at a few hundred bytes per delivery instead of up to 2× `maxBodyBytes`; dedup
  rows are pruned on their own short window (`INGRESS_DEDUP_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 7 — a dedup
  oracle is not an audit log, and `<= 0` falls back to the default rather than disabling the prune
  into unbounded growth).
- **`integration_delivery_failures`** — a dead-letter record of last resort for both directions, with a
  redrive path (added in P1).

## 25.6 Security model

- **Authentication inversion.** A provider webhook cannot carry an OpenWA API key, so ingress is public to
  the API-key guard but validates a **per-instance HMAC (or shared secret)** over the **raw** request
  bytes with a constant-time comparison. The raw body is preserved by a verify callback on the body parser
  because a re-serialized payload is not byte-identical to what the provider signed. The route is exempt from
  the global per-IP throttle and bounded on two keys instead: the client IP, checked by its own guard before
  anything else, and `(pluginId, instanceId)`, charged only once the delivery's signature verifies. A
  provider delivering every tenant's webhooks from one egress address would otherwise be shed at the global
  tier before the per-instance bound ever fired. The payload is intentionally not bound to a DTO so strict
  validation cannot reject unknown provider fields.
- **Replay and duplication.** A signed-timestamp tolerance rejects stale deliveries, and
  `(pluginId, instanceId, providerDeliveryId)` deduplication plus a queue job id keyed on the delivery id
  provides best-effort de-duplication when the provider supplies a stable delivery id. Standard Webhooks defaults
  to its signed `webhook-id`; other handlers must remain idempotent because arbitrary provider headers
  are not authenticated by every scheme. A route whose provider mints a fresh delivery id on every retry
  attempt can declare `dedupOn: "body"` to key retries on the raw body instead: byte-identical bodies
  then collapse within `INGRESS_DEDUP_RETENTION_DAYS`, the persisted delivery id and the `{id}` ack
  token become that content hash, and a provider whose retries legitimately differ in the signed body
  should keep the default, since `body` would dedup nothing for it. Freshness is enforced whenever a route declares
  `signature.timestampHeader`: the declared `toleranceSec` wins, and otherwise the host default
  (`INGRESS_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC`, default 300) applies — a declared timestamp is never accepted
  without a freshness check. Freshness alone is not replay protection, though: an **unsigned**
  timestamp can simply be re-minted by whoever replays a captured (body, signature) pair with a new
  delivery id. hmac-sha256 routes should therefore bind the timestamp into the signed bytes by
  including `{timestamp}` in the `contentTemplate` (e.g. `{timestamp}.{rawBody}`, the Chatwoot shape)
  so the signature itself expires with the window; the loader warns when a route declares the header
  without signing it (or signs the token without declaring the header). `standard-webhooks` binds
  id + timestamp by spec. A provider that sends no timestamp header at all stays outside the replay
  window by construction. For such an hmac-sha256 route, and for every `shared-secret` route, the default
  header-keyed dedup does not stop a copy of a delivery: the dedup header is not covered by the
  credential, so a copy with a different header value is accepted as new. `dedupOn: "body"` collapses
  byte-identical copies within `INGRESS_DEDUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (a copy gets the route's ack and is not
  enqueued again); beyond that, handler idempotency is the only protection. The loader logs a warning
  for each such route that keeps the header-keyed default.
  The value of a route's declared signature header (hmac-sha256 or shared-secret) is redacted from the
  persisted and enqueued payload, like the well-known signature headers, so the plugin's handler sees
  `[redacted]` in its place.
- **Tenancy scoping.** Every durable ingress artifact — secret, dedup store, and dead-letter row — is
  partitioned by instance. Downstream capability calls are limited to the sessions the plugin's manifest
  allows and, for a session-scoped plugin (the default), to the sessions it is activated for (the union of
  its instances' scopes plus any operator activation); they are not checked against the dispatching
  instance's scope.
- **Fail-closed by construction.** No request — including an empty-body request — is accepted by an
  authenticating scheme without the correct per-instance secret. HMAC and Standard Webhooks bind body
  integrity; `shared-secret` authenticates only the caller header and does not bind the body.
  `scheme: "none"` is the only unauthenticated path, and a route declaring it **fails the whole plugin's
  load** unless the operator has explicitly opted in with `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_INGRESS=true` — manifest
  validation throws, so none of that plugin's other routes load either and its registry status is set to
  `ERROR`. When the operator has opted in, the loader still logs its boot warning for every such route.
- **Raw-body content types.** Signature verification observes exact bytes for `application/json` and
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Plain text, XML, octet streams, and non-UTF JSON charsets are not
  supported ingress body formats and are refused with `415` on every signature scheme, before
  verification or persistence, rather than being re-serialized.
- **Egress.** The only sanctioned outbound path remains the SSRF-guarded `ctx.net.fetch`, scoped to the
  manifest's allowed hosts; a direct Node socket opened by the worker is not covered (see [30 - Plugin
  Sandboxing](./30-plugin-sandboxing.md)).
- **Re-entrancy.** A reply issued _inside_ an ingress handler seeds the in-flight hook set, so an adapter's
  own outbound message hook cannot echo-loop the reply back out to the external system.

## 25.7 Scale and durability

Persist-before-acknowledge; best-effort de-duplication keyed by a stable provider delivery id and queue
job id; per-instance fairness via a token bucket; and a dead-letter record with bounded redrive. On the
queued worker path, an **in-process** per-conversation lock prevents concurrent starts for the same lane;
strict FIFO is not preserved across retry/redrive, and the lock is single-node state rather than Redis or
PostgreSQL state. When the queue is disabled, ingress dispatches inline after persisting and does not
serialize concurrent same-conversation deliveries. Providers already deliver over unordered,
at-least-once HTTP, so plugin handlers must be idempotent and treat ingress as a reconciliation trigger.

A job waiting on that lock still holds one of the `INGRESS_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` worker slots (default
10). A burst on one lane larger than that fills every slot with same-lane waiters, and events for other
conversations and instances queue behind the burst until it drains. Size `INGRESS_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`
above the largest burst you expect on a single lane, and declare a `conversationId` pointer on the
route so the lane is one conversation; without it the lane is the whole instance.

Persist-before-acknowledge alone is not delivery: a crash between the persist and the enqueue, or a
fire-and-forget enqueue on a `response` route whose outcome is never recorded, would strand the row
with the provider already acknowledged. The **ingress reconciler** closes that window: every
`INGRESS_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` (default 60s, `0` disables; a blank value falls back to the
default, and a negative or unparseable value fails the boot) it re-dispatches a bounded batch
(`INGRESS_RECONCILE_BATCH_SIZE`, default 50) of `pending` rows whose last activity is older than a
grace period (`INGRESS_RECONCILE_GRACE_MS`, default 60s), through the same queue-or-inline enqueue the
live path uses and with the original delivery id as job id, so a replay is idempotent against a job
the crashed live path may have enqueued. The stored row is sufficient for re-dispatch — while
`pending` it is the full verified request (headers/query/body/rawBody) plus the route and session
provenance; the conversation lane is re-derived from the current manifest. After
`INGRESS_RECONCILE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 5) the row goes `failed` and a dead-letter row is
guaranteed to exist **before** the row's payload is retired, so recovery continues through the
bounded redrive path instead of an infinite replay loop; a successful replay likewise retires the
row's payload with the `dispatched` mark and retires any live-path dead-letter row for the same
delivery so a later redrive never double-delivers. The replay looks the queue job up first: a job
still in the queue or completed, or a live or completed re-queued copy of it, takes the `dispatched`
mark without a second enqueue, and a job that failed with no such copy is not replayed: the row goes
`failed` with a dead-letter row guaranteed as above, so none is written while a copy can still
deliver. A `pending` row found without a payload (only possible for imported/corrupt history —
payloads are retired only with a recorded outcome) is excluded from the sweep and never replayed
empty; nothing logs it, and it stays `pending` until `INGRESS_DEDUP_RETENTION_DAYS` prunes it.

Table growth is bounded by construction rather than by operator hygiene: the per-instance ingress
throttle caps the row-creation rate, dispatched rows slim to a marker + hash, and the two retention
windows prune what remains — `INGRESS_DEDUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) for the dedup oracle and
`INGRESS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90, `<= 0` disables) for the DLQ. There is deliberately no
per-instance row-count cap: eviction under a flood of forged delivery ids would silently drop legit
dedup rows and re-admit their replays, which is worse than the bounded growth it would prevent.

## 25.8 The Integration SDK (v1)

The stable surface sandboxed adapters consume. A plugin declares `sdkVersion: "1"` and an `ingress`
descriptor (the route, which is a single URL path segment such as `chatwoot` and never contains a `/`, its
signature scheme, replay tolerance, dedup header, and an optional verification handshake) in its manifest,
and requests the `webhook:ingress` and `conversation:send` permissions. The host refuses to load an
ingress-declaring plugin whose declared **major** differs from the host's supported major, and the surface
is **additive-only** within a major. The worker-facing API centres on `ctx.registerWebhook(...)` (claim an
inbound route), `ctx.conversations.send(...)` (normalized reply), and per-instance mapping and handover
helpers.

The `signature.scheme` field enumerates `hmac-sha256` (HMAC over a `contentTemplate`), `shared-secret`
(constant-time header compare), `standard-webhooks`, and `none` (unauthenticated — a route declaring it
fails the whole plugin's load unless the operator sets `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_INGRESS=true`; see §25.6). The
`standard-webhooks` scheme verifies a [Standard Webhooks](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks)
payload host-side — Supabase Auth's Send-SMS hook and any Svix-routed provider speak it natively. Its wire
format is fixed by the spec (the `webhook-id` / `webhook-timestamp` / `webhook-signature` header triple,
signed over `${id}.${timestamp}.${rawBody}`), so only `toleranceSec` (falling back to the host
`INGRESS_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC`, default 300) and `dedupHeader` apply; `header`, `contentTemplate`,
`encoding`, `prefix`, and `timestampHeader` are ignored, and the
operator pastes the provider's Svix secret (`v1,whsec_<base64>`) as the instance secret. It is the
recommended scheme for Standard-Webhooks providers: because the `session-alive` preflight (§25.4) runs
_after_ signature verification, an unauthenticated caller can no longer use that preflight as a liveness
oracle on a route that previously declared `scheme: "none"`. The existing `hmac-sha256`/`shared-secret`/
`none` behavior is unchanged. For `hmac-sha256`, declaring `timestampHeader` always activates the replay
window (§25.6) — declare it together with a `contentTemplate` that includes `{timestamp}` so the checked
timestamp is also signed.

Within major 1 the surface grows additively. A route's optional `response` contract — `preflight[]`
(host-side checks such as `session-alive`, evaluated after signature verify), `ack{}` (`status`/`body`/
`headers`, rendered host-side with `{rawBody}`/`{timestamp}`/`{id}` templates from the verified request),
and an advisory `deadlineMs` — lets an adapter shape the synchronous HTTP response the provider sees; the
plugin still always runs async, and a route with no `response` is byte-identical to today's default
fast-ack. `ack.body` and every `ack.headers` value must be strings, `ack.status` must be a final status
(200-599), and a header value may hold no control character (other than HTAB) and nothing above U+00FF,
since Node cannot write one; a manifest that declares otherwise is refused at install and at boot, which
leaves that plugin in error until the manifest is fixed. A declared header is dropped rather than written
when it is one of these thirteen names: `content-type`, which the host sets itself (a declared
`application/json` or `text/plain` is honored as the bare media type with `charset=utf-8`, and any other
declared type, or none, is sent as `text/plain`, so a reflected ack is never served as executable
content); `content-length`, `transfer-encoding`, `content-encoding` and `trailer`, since the host frames
the response itself and never compresses it; `set-cookie`, `access-control-allow-origin` and
`access-control-allow-credentials`; and `content-security-policy`, `x-content-type-options`,
`x-frame-options`, `strict-transport-security` and `referrer-policy`, the response protections the host
sets for every request. Every other declared header goes out verbatim.

The `mode: 'sync-reply'` value is **deprecated** in favor of `response`: it was inert dead code
that was never wired to the HTTP response (the pipeline is always async + fast-ack), and it is kept in the
`mode` union only to preserve SDK v1 additive-only compatibility — do not remove it within major 1, and do
not rely on it at runtime.

The full SDK reference — every manifest field, the envelope schema, the lifecycle, and the golden
compatibility fixtures — is a P4 deliverable and is not published yet, so this document and the manifest
types remain the source of truth.

## 25.9 Phasing and status

See [15 - Project Roadmap](./15-project-roadmap.md) for the full phase table. In brief: **P0** (this
substrate) is merged; **P1** added scale-correctness (per-conversation ordering, per-instance fairness,
DLQ redrive, handover); **P2** shipped operator provisioning in v0.8.0 — an ADMIN-only instance API
(`POST|GET /api/integration/plugins/:pluginId/instances` to create and list, with
`GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/integration/plugins/:pluginId/instances/:instanceId` and
`POST /api/integration/plugins/:pluginId/instances/:instanceId/regenerate-secret` on the item path) and a
dashboard **Instances** tab; **P3** validated the substrate against a second ingress adapter
(`supabase-otp-hook`). The official
ingress adapters ship as sandboxed plugins in the
[OpenWA-plugins](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA-plugins) catalog, not in this repository. What
remains open is **P4**: the published SDK reference, a compatibility test suite, and multi-node routing.

> **Provisioning is a first-class operator surface.** An ADMIN key mints a plugin instance against an
> ingress-capable plugin, binds it to a session scope, and receives the ingress URLs for the plugin's
