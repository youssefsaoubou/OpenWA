# 27 - Writing a Search-Provider Plugin

> **Status:** The host→plugin search RPC shipped in v0.8.14 (PR #674). A sandboxed plugin can now register
> as a `SearchProvider` and answer `GET /api/search` queries from its own backend (Meilisearch,
> Elasticsearch, Typesense, OpenSearch, …) while the core stays backend-agnostic. This guide is the
> plugin-author's contract.

## 27.1 What it is

A **search-provider plugin** owns a search backend. It does two things:

1. **Indexes** messages — via the `message:persisted` hook (the plugin stays in sync with live traffic).
2. **Answers queries** — via `ctx.registerSearchProvider(handler)`. The host routes `GET /api/search` to
   the plugin over a correlated `search` / `search-result` wire protocol and returns the plugin's
   `SearchResults` to the caller.

The core never talks to the search backend directly — all vendor-specific logic (the query builder, the
API client, the index schema) lives in the plugin. Swapping backends is a config change
(`SEARCH_PROVIDER`), not a code change. See [26 - Global Search](./26-global-search.md) for the
user-facing feature and the built-in DB-FTS default.

## 27.2 The contract

### Declare the permission

The manifest must declare `search:provide`:

```json
{
  "id": "meili",
  "name": "Meilisearch",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "extension",
  "main": "index.cjs",
  "permissions": ["search:provide"]
}
```

Without it the host ignores the registration and logs one warning
(`sandbox_search_provider_denied`); the plugin keeps running and the active provider is unchanged.
The permission is required because under the default `SEARCH_PROVIDER=auto` a registered provider is
also made **active**, so it sees every query `GET /api/search` serves.

### Register the handler

In `onEnable`, call `ctx.registerSearchProvider(handler)` with a function that takes a `SearchQuery` and
returns a `SearchResults`:

```ts
ctx.registerSearchProvider(async (query) => {
  // query: SearchQuery — { q, sessionIds?, sessionId?, chatId?, direction?, type?, from?, dateFrom?, dateTo?, limit?, offset? }
  // Run your backend's query here (e.g. a Meilisearch /search call).
  return {
    hits: [...],   // SearchHit[] — see below
    total: 123,    // bounded exact count for pagination
    tookMs: 7,     // your query time in ms
    provider: `plugin:${ctx.pluginId}`,  // your provider id (the host derives `plugin:<id>` automatically)
  };
});
```

A plugin may register **one** search handler (calling `registerSearchProvider` again replaces it; the
host is notified once). If `onEnable` throws after registering, the host cleans up (the provider is
unregistered).

### The `SearchHit` shape

Each hit must carry every field below — the dashboard + the SDKs consume them directly:

```ts
{
  messageId: string;      // your stable id for the message (the core Message PK is the convention)
  waMessageId: string;    // the WhatsApp message id (empty string if unknown)
  sessionId: string;
  chatId: string;
  body: string;           // the full message body (the dashboard may truncate for display)
  snippet: string;        // excerpt with <mark>…</mark> around the matched term(s) — render as TEXT, never HTML
  timestamp: number;      // epoch-seconds (matches the core messages.timestamp column)
  type: string;           // the MessageType ('text', 'image', …)
  direction: string;      // 'incoming' | 'outgoing'
  from: string;           // sender jid / phone
  score?: number;         // optional relevance score (backend-specific)
}
```

The `<mark>` snippet markers are the **only** highlight convention — the dashboard renders the snippet as
text (escape-then-highlight), never as HTML. Do not inject HTML.

## 27.3 Indexing via the `message:persisted` hook

The core fires `message:persisted` for every live message (outbound on send, inbound on receive, and again
when a stored message is revoked) — never for history backfill. Register a handler to keep your index in
sync:

```ts
ctx.registerHook('message:persisted', async hookCtx => {
  const { sessionId, message } = hookCtx.data;
  // message carries: id, waMessageId, sessionId, chatId, body, from, to, type, direction, timestamp, …
  await myBackend.index(message); // fire-and-forget is fine; an error here doesn't break the send/receive
});
```

**Outbound rows are re-emitted on every state transition.** An API-originated send first emits the row
as `PENDING` (usually with `waMessageId` still null), then emits it **again** with the same `id` once it
reaches its terminal state (`SENT` with the engine id, or `FAILED`). Key your documents by the row `id`
and treat every emission as an upsert, and your index always converges to the finalized state.

**A revoke re-emits the row too.** When a message of either direction is revoked (an engine
`message.revoked`, or `POST /messages/delete`, whether or not `forEveryone` is set), the core clears the
stored row and emits `message:persisted` again with the same `id`, an empty `body`, `type: 'revoked'` and
null `metadata`. An upsert keyed by `id` therefore drops the deleted content from your index; do not count
the emission as a new message.

One race remains visible by design: when the engine's own-send echo wins, the redundant PENDING row is
merged into the echo's row and then dropped. The core emits `message:persisted` for the surviving row
(upsert it) followed by `message:deleted` for the dropped one — delete that document by its `id`:

```ts
ctx.registerHook('message:deleted', async hookCtx => {
  const { message } = hookCtx.data;
  await myBackend.delete(message.id);
});
```

Clearing a chat's messages (`DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/chats/:chatId/messages`) or deleting a chat
(`POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/chats/delete`) also emits `message:deleted` for every stored row it removes, so
the same handler keeps your index in step.
Rows removed in bulk emit no `message:deleted`: deleting a session and message retention (`MESSAGE_RETENTION_DAYS`) leave the plugin's copies in its index until the plugin removes them itself.

**Backfill is the plugin's responsibility.** The hook fires only for live traffic. A plugin installed on
a deployment with existing message history must perform its own one-time backfill. The only sanctioned
path is `ctx.engine.getChats(sessionId)` followed by `ctx.engine.getChatHistory(sessionId, chatId, limit)`,
which needs the `engine:read` permission and a session in the plugin's scope. It reads live from WhatsApp,
not from the core `messages` table, and returns at most the 100 most recent messages per chat.

`getChatHistory` exists only on the whatsapp-web.js engine. On Baileys it rejects with
`EngineNotSupportedError` (see [29 - Engine Capability Matrix](./29-engine-capability-matrix.md)), so a
Baileys deployment has no backfill path and a provider there indexes live `message:persisted` traffic
only. A sandboxed plugin receives that rejection as a plain `Error` (its class and name do not cross the
worker boundary) whose message starts with `Operation not supported by the active engine`. Match on that
prefix on the first chat and skip the backfill rather than retrying it chat after chat.

There is no capability that reads the `messages` table. Reading the database directly bypasses the
capability model and is unsupported; see [30 - Plugin Sandboxing](./30-plugin-sandboxing.md) for what a
loaded plugin can still reach.

Backfilled items carry only the WhatsApp id (`id` there is the WhatsApp message id), not the core row PK.
Keep a `waMessageId` lookup too, and when a later `message:persisted` arrives for a message you already
backfilled, upsert onto that document instead of adding a second one.

Start the backfill per session from a `ctx.registerHook('session:ready', ...)` handler (the session is
`hookCtx.sessionId`), without awaiting it: a sandboxed hook is cut off after 5 s and a lifecycle call
after 30 s, and walking every chat's history takes longer on a real deployment. Do not rely on `onEnable`
alone: it also runs at boot, when the host re-enables the plugin before any session engine is up, so an
engine read there fails (no active engine, or one still initializing) and a session linked later is never
covered. No `ctx` capability lists sessions or reports their status, so in `onEnable` try only the
session ids the plugin already knows (its `manifest.sessions` list or its own config) and leave any whose
engine read fails (no active engine, or one not yet ready) to its `session:ready` hook.
Record a per-session marker in `ctx.storage` (which needs the `storage:use` permission) when that
session's backfill finishes, and skip a session whose marker is set, so a restart resumes an interrupted
backfill and does not repeat a finished one. Keep an in-memory set of sessions whose backfill is running
too, so a repeated `session:ready` (a reconnect) does not start a second walk alongside the first. The
built-in DB-FTS provider is unaffected (its index is DB-synced via triggers on every insert, including
backfill).

## 27.4 Host-side guarantees (the plugin author doesn't handle these)

The host enforces these before/after the RPC, so the plugin doesn't have to:

- **Pagination cap.** `limit` is clamped to `SEARCH_LIMIT_MAX` (default 100) and `offset` to
  `SEARCH_OFFSET_MAX` before the query reaches the plugin. The plugin still receives the bounded values;
  honor them.
- **Session-scope re-filter.** The host re-filters the plugin's returned hits against the caller's
  `allowedSessions` (defense-in-depth — the plugin is trusted to scope, but the host verifies). A scoped
  key never sees an out-of-scope hit even if the plugin leaks one.
- **Timeout.** The plugin's `search()` handler must answer within **10 seconds** (`SANDBOX_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS`).
  A slow/wedged handler resolves `ok:false` → the caller sees `503 Service Unavailable`. Fail fast.
- **Health.** The search provider's health reuses the plugin's general `healthCheck()` (the `health`
  lifecycle method), but search-provider health is not yet exposed on any route. `healthCheck()` still
  feeds the plugin health check (`GET /api/plugins/:id/health`); implement it to report your backend's
  reachability.
- **Selection.** When `SEARCH_PROVIDER=auto` (the default), the plugin supersedes the built-in
  `builtin-fts` on enable. Set `SEARCH_PROVIDER=builtin-fts` to keep the built-in active. Selection is
  not health-gated: the plugin stays active while its `healthCheck()` reports unhealthy.

      const results = await this._search(ctx, query); // your backend's query
      return {
        hits: results.rows.map(r => ({
          messageId: String(r.id),
          waMessageId: r.waMessageId ?? '',
          sessionId: r.sessionId,
          chatId: r.chatId,
          body: r.body,

          direction: r.direction,
          from: r.from,
          score: r.score,
        })),
        total: results.total,
        tookMs: Date.now() - start,
        provider: `plugin:${ctx.pluginId}`,
      };
    });
  }

  // Your backend-specific methods:
  async _index(ctx, message) {
    /* upsert into your index */
  }
  async _search(ctx, query) {
    /* run your backend's query, honoring query.q + filters + limit/offset */ return { rows: [], total: 0 };
  }
  _highlight(body, term) {
    // Escape the query so `c++` or `(` matches literally instead of throwing a SyntaxError.
    const escaped = term.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');
    return body.replace(new RegExp(escaped, 'gi'), '<mark>$&</mark>');
  }
  async _pingBackend() {
    /* ping your backend */ return true;
  }

  // Optional: report backend health to the plugin health check.
  async healthCheck() {
    const ok = await this._pingBackend();
    return { healthy: ok, message: ok ? undefined : 'backend unreachable' };
  }
};
```

## 27.6 TypeScript plugin authors

The contract types are exported from the core:

```ts
import type { SearchQuery, SearchResults, SearchHit } from '../../modules/search/search.types';
```

(Add the OpenWA repo as a devDependency or reference the types via a `paths` mapping. A standalone
`@openwa/plugin-types` package is planned.)

The worker context a sandboxed plugin receives exposes: `pluginId`, `config` (per-session-resolved),
`logger`, the capability bridge (`messages`, `engine`, `storage`, `net`, …), `registerHook`,
`registerWebhook`, and `registerSearchProvider`. (A formal `@openwa/plugin-types` package with the full
ctx interface is planned; for now the search contract types above are the stable surface.)

## 27.7 Gotchas

- **`timestamp` is epoch-seconds**, not epoch-ms (matches the core `messages.timestamp` column). The
  `dateFrom`/`dateTo` in the query are epoch-ms; convert if your backend uses ms.
- **The provider id is `plugin:<manifest.id>`** — the host derives it; your `SearchResults.provider`
  should match (`plugin:${ctx.pluginId}`).
- **The 10s timeout is hard.** A backend that's slow under load returns 503 (the host fails fast, never
  hangs the `/search` request). Use a backend-side query timeout shorter than 10s.
- **Session scope is authoritative.** The caller's `allowedSessions` is injected by the host into
  `query.sessionIds` — the plugin should honor it (filter by `sessionIds` in the backend query) for
  correct results + performance. The host re-filters as defense-in-depth, but a plugin that ignores
  `sessionIds` returns more rows than needed (wasteful) and relies on the host to strip them.
- **`message:persisted` is fire-and-forget.** An error in the indexing handler is swallowed (it must not
  break the send/receive pipeline). Log errors via `ctx.logger` and retry/mirror in your backend's own
  retry queue if you need stronger delivery guarantees.
