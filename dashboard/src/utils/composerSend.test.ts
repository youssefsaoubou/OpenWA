/**
 * Replying with an attachment used to drop the quote silently.
 *
 * The composer treated "has an attachment" and "is replying" as mutually exclusive — the media
 * branch never carried the quoted id, and the optimistic bubble's metadata took the same either/or.
 * Because the reply banner is cleared before the send either way, the UI looked exactly like a
 * successful quoted reply. Nothing failed, so nothing surfaced it.
 *
 * These are the two payloads that were wrong, extracted so they can be asserted directly. Rendering
 * the composer would also work — `pages/Chats.test.ts` and two siblings do render real components
 * under jsdom — but that path costs a jsdom install and `createElement` scaffolding (the runner
 * cannot parse JSX, so `.test.tsx` is not an option), and these are pure payload builders with no
 * DOM in them. Most of this project's suites test `utils/` for the same reason.
