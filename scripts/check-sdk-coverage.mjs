/**
 * SDK contract-coverage guard — the reverse of check-sdk-routes.
 *
 * `check-sdk-routes` asks: does every route an SDK builds exist in the contract? That catches a
 * renamed route. It cannot catch a route the gateway publishes that no client ever got, because
 * nothing is there to scan. Ten routes reached `main` that way, all of them added in the release
 * that announced them.
 *
 * So this asks the other question: does every route the contract publishes, minus the resources
 * `sdk/README.md` declares unexposed, have a method in EVERY SDK?
 *
 * PER SDK, deliberately. A total across the five would pass while two clients were missing a route
 * three others had — which is the shape of the gap this exists to prevent. Every failure names the
 * client, not just the route.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated so the guarantee is not read wider than it is:
 *   - Asserts a route is REACHABLE from each client, that each verb of a multi-verb route is built,
 *     and that no verb/path pair the verb scan harvests uses a verb the contract does not declare;
 *     not that its body or response match. A call the scan cannot pair with its path (the messages
 *     send-<type> helpers, binary downloads, Go's service helpers and `path :=` variables) is not
 *     verb-checked, so a wrong verb on a single-verb route built that way passes.
 *   - The exclusion list is PARSED from sdk/README.md, so the gate and the promise cannot drift.
 *
 * The harvester is deliberately GENEROUS: it over-approximates what each client builds. That is the
 * safe direction here. A gate that fails on a route the SDK does have is noise, and a noisy gate
 * gets switched off; the defect being hunted leaves no literal anywhere, so generosity cannot hide
 * it. Four rounds of narrowing false positives produced the current rules — see harvestFile.
 *
 * Run locally: `npm run check:sdk-coverage`.
