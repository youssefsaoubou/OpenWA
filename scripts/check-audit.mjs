/**
 * Dependency-audit gate for the ROOT tree, with a per-advisory allowlist.
 *
 * `npm audit --audit-level=high` is all-or-nothing: it fails on any high, and the only lever it
 * offers is lowering the threshold for EVERYTHING. That lever is the wrong one — the audit job
 * exists to fence high-severity regressions, and dropping it to `critical` would silently un-gate
 * every future high to accommodate one advisory that has no fix.
 *
 * So the threshold stays, and an advisory is excused ONE AT A TIME, by id, with its reason recorded
 * next to it. An excused advisory is still visible in `npm audit` output; what changes is only
 * whether CI treats it as a stop.
 *
 * Two rules, and the second is the one that keeps this honest:
 *   1. Any advisory at `high` or `critical` whose id is not allowlisted FAILS.
 *   2. An allowlist entry whose advisory no longer appears ALSO FAILS. A carve-out that outlives
 *      its cause is how a gate quietly narrows, so removing it is not left to anyone remembering.
 *
 * Scope: the root tree only. `dashboard/` keeps a plain `npm audit --audit-level=high`, because it
 * has nothing to excuse and should stay the stricter of the two.
 *
 * Run locally: `npm run check:audit`.
