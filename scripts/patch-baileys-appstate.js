/**
 * Bound Baileys' app-state resync loop so an unanswered query cannot spin it.
 *
 * `resyncAppState` (lib/Socket/chats.js) drives `while (collectionsToHandle.size)` until every
 * collection reports no more patches. Each pass issues an `iq` through `query()` — and `query()`
 * catches its own `defaultQueryTimeoutMs` (60s) and RESOLVES `undefined` rather than throwing. That
 * `undefined` reaches `extractSyncdPatches`, which yields `{}` (verified by execution against the
 * installed module, alongside a real-node control that also yields `{}`).
 *
 * Every exit from the loop — each `collectionsToHandle.delete(name)`, and every increment of the
 * `attemptsMap` the library's own comment introduces to "ensure we don't enter a loop that cannot be
 * exited from" — lives INSIDE `for (const key in decoded)`. With `decoded` empty that body never
 * runs, so nothing is removed, nothing is counted, and the guard never engages. The loop then burns
 * one 60-second query per pass for as long as the socket lives. It is not permanent: the `await
 * query(...)` sits outside the loop's try/catch, so a socket close rejects out of resyncAppState
 * entirely. On a long-lived gateway that is still on the order of a thousand wasted queries a day.
 *
 * The transform adds the exit the guard assumes: an empty decode ends the walk. Nothing came back,
 * and re-asking in a tight loop is what produced the defect — a later connect re-runs the sync
 * anyway (OpenWA calls it on every `open`).
 *
 * Exact and self-disabling, matching the whatsapp-web.js patchers: an unknown shape fails rather
 * than silently shipping without the fix. Remove this once upstream bounds the loop.
