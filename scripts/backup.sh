# OpenWA backup.
#
# Captures the load-bearing state needed to restore a working install:
#   - main.sqlite   — auth (API keys) + audit log, ALWAYS SQLite (see app.module.ts)
#   - data store    — openwa.sqlite (SQLite) OR a pg_dump (when DATABASE_TYPE=postgres)
#   - sessions/     — whatsapp-web.js LocalAuth session data
#   - baileys/      — Baileys engine authentication state
#   - media/        — the local media dir (STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH), archived whenever it exists. Under
#                     STORAGE_TYPE=s3 it holds only media the app could not write to the bucket
#                     (unreachable, or no credentials); the bucket's contents are not archived and
#                     need a backup of their own
#   - plugin-packages/ — installed plugin packages from PLUGINS_DIR
#   - plugin-state/    — registry and persisted ctx.storage state under PLUGIN_STATE_DIR/plugins
#                        (default: <data dir>/plugins)
#   - .env.generated and .api-key — dashboard config and plaintext bootstrap admin key
#
# The previous runbook backed up the wrong file (openwa.db) and omitted main.sqlite,
# so a "successful" backup silently lost every API key and all audit history.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/backup.sh
# Environment:
#   MAIN_DATABASE_NAME  auth/audit SQLite file (default: ./data/main.sqlite)
#   DATABASE_NAME       data-store SQLite file (default: ./data/openwa.sqlite; sqlite only)
#                       Both resolve EXACTLY like the app: the environment first, then ./.env, then
#                       <data dir>/.env.generated, otherwise the fixed ./data default (see
#                       lib-env.sh). They are NOT derived from OPENWA_DATA_DIR — the app never does
#                       that either.
#   OPENWA_DATA_DIR   data directory for the non-DB state below (default: ./data)
#   BACKUP_DIR        where archives are written (default: ./backups)
#   DATABASE_TYPE     sqlite (default) | postgres
#   SESSION_DATA_PATH, BAILEYS_AUTH_DIR, STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH, PLUGINS_DIR
#                     override the corresponding state directories
#   PLUGIN_STATE_DIR  root whose plugins/ holds the plugin registry and ctx.storage (default: the
#                     data dir)
#   BOOTSTRAP_KEY_FILE  the plaintext admin key to archive (default: <data dir>/.api-key)
#                     These paths resolve through the same layers as the databases.
#   For postgres: DATABASE_URL, or DATABASE_HOST/PORT/USERNAME/PASSWORD/NAME
#                     DATABASE_URL is read by this script only (the app uses the DATABASE_* keys)
#                     and wins over them when set. It is passed to pg_dump as an argument, which
#                     other local users can read in the process list, so leave the password out of
#                     it and supply PGPASSWORD or ~/.pgpass instead; the DATABASE_* path already
#                     passes DATABASE_PASSWORD through PGPASSWORD.
#
# Failure policy: a missing source database is FATAL (no silent empty backup), and the finished
# archive must contain every configured database or it is deleted and the run fails. When the
# sqlite3 CLI is unavailable the databases are plain-copied (possibly torn if the app is live) and
# the archive carries a CONSISTENCY-WARNING marker that restore.sh surfaces.
#
# Engine authentication state (sessions/, baileys/) is copied, not snapshotted: the engines rewrite
# it while they run, so an online backup can hold a copy torn mid-write. When a whatsapp-web.js
# profile is open or Baileys state is present, the archive carries an ENGINE-STATE-NOTE that
# restore.sh prints without refusing (--strict gates only the database marker). For a copy that is
# consistent by construction, stop the sessions (or the container) first.
#
set -euo pipefail
