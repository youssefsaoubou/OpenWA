/**
 * Stop Baileys' newsletter-create parser from throwing away a channel it just created.
 *
 * `parseNewsletterCreateResponse` (lib/Socket/newsletter.js) builds its result eagerly and reads
 * `thread.picture.id` unconditionally. But `newsletterCreate` sends `input: { name, description }`
 * and its signature is `(name, description?)` — there is **no picture parameter anywhere in the
 * chain** — so a newly created newsletter has no picture and `thread.picture` is null on EVERY
 * create. The parse therefore throws `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')` for
 * every single call, not for an unlucky subset.
 *
 * The damage is worse than a failed request. WhatsApp creates the newsletter **server-side first**;
 * the parser dies afterwards, on the response. So the caller receives a 500 believing nothing
 * happened, while a real channel is left behind — and `createChannel` is non-idempotent, so a client
 * that retries a 5xx leaks one orphan channel per attempt. Confirmed on the test account: two failed
 * calls, two orphan channels, found only by looking at the handset. There is no API path to find
 * them on that engine, because `getSubscribedChannels` answers 501 on Baileys.
 *
 * **Recovering the id is the point, not merely not crashing.** `response.id` is the only place the
 * new channel's id ever appears, so a parser that returns without it would convert "500 plus an
 * orphan" into "200 with no handle" — arguably worse, since nothing would look wrong. Every nested
 * read is therefore made defensive: whatever else is absent, the id survives.
 *
 * `description` has the same defect and is reachable through this gateway's own API: the create DTO
 * makes it optional and `newsletterCreate` sends `description ?? null`, so a channel created without
 * one gets `thread.description === null` and `thread.description.text` throws exactly as the picture
 * read does.
 *
 * Exact and self-disabling, like the other patchers: an unknown shape fails rather than silently
 * shipping unpatched.
 *
 * **RETIRE THIS, do not keep it.** It compensates for an upstream bug with an obvious upstream fix,
 * and it is not tied to a WhatsApp Web version the way the whatsapp-web.js patchers are. Delete it
 * once @whiskeysockets/baileys tolerates a pictureless newsletter in this parser.
