 * The Dockerfile hand-lists the patchers it copies into the production stage and the ones it runs

 * from the image, postinstall's fs.existsSync guard skips it without a word, and the fix it carries
 * never reaches the published image. That is exactly what happened to the Baileys app-state
 * patcher, which shipped in postinstall and was never added here.
 *
 * Derive the set instead of restating it.
