#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Smoke test: scripts/backup.sh + scripts/restore.sh.
#
# Covers:
#   (a) custom MAIN_DATABASE_NAME / DATABASE_NAME are honored by BOTH scripts
#   (b) a missing source database fails hard (non-zero, clear message, no archive)
#   (c) backup -> restore roundtrip via sqlite3 .backup (skipped with a notice when the host
#       has no sqlite3 — everything else still runs)
#   (d) the cp fallback writes a CONSISTENCY-WARNING marker into the archive, restore warns
#       but continues, and restore --strict refuses
#   (e) the archive min-content check rejects (and deletes) an archive missing a required DB
#   (f) data/.env.generated supplies paths the environment does not, and restore reads the archive's copy
#   (g) PLUGIN_STATE_DIR plugin state is archived and restored at the configured root
#   (h) restore refuses a live target without --force, before touching anything
#   (i) the data-store half of that guard refuses on its own
#   (j) a probe that fails or prints no usable count leaves the target counted as live
#   (k) an operator's sqlite3 rc file changes neither answer of the guard (skipped without sqlite3)
#   (l) an unwritable BACKUP_DIR fails before anything is staged (skipped as root)
#   (m) OPENWA_RESTORE_SNAPSHOT_DIR takes the data-dir snapshot off a read-only parent (skipped as root)
#   (n) a state dir outside the data dir is snapshotted before any database is written, and under
#       OPENWA_RESTORE_SNAPSHOT_DIR when that is set (skipped as root)
#   (o) such a state dir under a read-only parent, a mount point in the container, is restored in
#       place (skipped as root)
#   (p) a symlinked database target or data dir is snapshotted as a copy of what the link points at
#   (q) a leftover -wal is cleared before a database is restored and kept in its snapshot (skipped
#       without sqlite3)
#   (r) a symlinked state dir is archived by content and restored through the link, and an archive
#       member that is itself a symlink is refused
#   (s) restored state lands where the restored data/.env.generated points, below ./.env
#   (t) ./.env lines with CRLF endings, blanks around = or trailing blanks resolve as dotenv reads them,
#       and a `KEY: value` line is reported
#   (u) a state, database or data-dir file target the restore cannot write stops it before any database
#       is written (skipped as root)
#   (v) a leftover STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH=./uploads the app cannot create falls back to ./data/media in
#       both scripts, and a missing media dir is reported (skipped as root)
#   (w) the default colocated plugins dir is rebuilt from both archive members, even when they differ
#   (x) a relocated BOOTSTRAP_KEY_FILE is archived and restored there, and an unwritable one is refused
#       before any database is written (that half skipped as root)
#   (y) plugin packages in the legacy ./plugins, which the archive does not carry, are reported
#   (z) a leftover ./uploads that was never created, beside an existing ./data/media, resolves there in
#       both scripts whatever the uid
#   (aa) engine auth state copied from a running app (an open whatsapp-web.js profile, Baileys state)
#       is noted in the archive and printed by restore, which does not refuse it even with --strict
#   (ab) a blank ./.env line keeps data/.env.generated from supplying the key, so the default applies
#   (ac) a missing Baileys auth dir is reported when data/.env.generated selects the Baileys engine
#   (ad) a file an engine deletes during the sessions/ or baileys/ copy is noted instead of failing the
#       backup, a file the app deletes during the media or plugin copies is logged, and any other cp
#       error still fails it, however long its output and whatever the host's locale
#   (ae) the min-content check passes an archive whose listing outgrows a pipe buffer
#   (af) the online SQLite backup waits out a writer holding the database lock (skipped without sqlite3)
#   (ag) quoted values, inline comments and `KEY=""` in ./.env resolve as dotenv reads them, and a line
#       the scripts cannot parse ends the lookup at the default instead of reading data/.env.generated
#
# Usage: ./scripts/smoke-test-backup-restore.sh
# Requires: bash, tar, node (restore.sh path resolution). sqlite3 is optional (see (c) and (k)).
