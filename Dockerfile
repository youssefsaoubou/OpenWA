# OpenWA - Dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production-ready image

# ===== Stage 1: Builder =====
# Pin the builder to the BUILD host's platform (not the target's). It only produces arch-INDEPENDENT
# artifacts (the NestJS dist/ JS and the static dashboard SPA), so it never needs to run emulated for
# the non-native target. On a multi-arch buildx build this avoids QEMU emulating the whole npm ci +
# Vite build for arm64 — which is slow AND is where the arm64 lightningcss (Vite 8's native CSS
# minifier) optional dependency fails to install ("Cannot find module lightningcss.linux-arm64-gnu.node").
# The per-arch runtime deps are installed natively in the target-platform production stage below.
# NOTE: $BUILDPLATFORM requires BuildKit (CI uses buildx; modern `docker build`/compose default to it).
# The digest pins the multi-arch node:22-slim index, so every build starts from the same immutable
# base. Dependabot proposes a refreshed digest when the tag moves; if none has arrived, refresh by
# hand (`docker buildx imagetools inspect docker.io/node:22-slim`). The base-image-drift job in
# security-scan.yml fails once the pin differs from what the tag serves and either the tag has
# served that image for 7 or more days, or for 3 or more days with the pin last changed 28 or more
# days ago. Update both stages together.

# The postinstall hook is a real file (scripts/postinstall.js), and `npm ci` fails outright when

# Install all dependencies INCLUDING devDependencies — the build needs them (`nest` from
# @nestjs/cli, plus `vite`/`typescript` for the dashboard). `--include=dev` is REQUIRED, not
# cosmetic: npm omits devDependencies whenever NODE_ENV=production is present in the build env.
# Coolify (and similar PaaS) promote every ${VAR} referenced in the compose file to a build-time
# variable, so docker-compose.yml's `NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-production}` leaks NODE_ENV=production
# into this stage and a bare `npm ci` would skip @nestjs/cli → `sh: 1: nest: not found` (exit 127).
# (docker-compose.dev.yml forwards `NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development}`, so the dev build only sees
# production when the host sets it.)
# This stage only builds dist/ and the dashboard SPA and never launches a browser; the production
# stage downloads Chrome explicitly. Skip the Puppeteer postinstall download so @puppeteer/browsers 3
# does not try to extract a zip here, where no archiver is installed.

# `--include=dev` for the same reason as above: the dashboard build needs vite/typescript
# (devDependencies), which a NODE_ENV=production build env would otherwise omit.
# Drop the incremental-build cache afterwards: it is pinned inside dist/ (so nest's deleteOutDir
# wipes it with the output), and the production stage copies dist/ wholesale — it would otherwise

# amd64 uses Chrome for Testing (downloaded below) to avoid the Debian chromium
# package's K8s SIGTRAP under strict non-root/seccomp. arm64 installs Debian's
# chromium instead, by choice: it ships a native arm64 build, Chrome for Testing
# publishes linux-arm64 builds only from 153 on, and Puppeteer's chromium snapshot
# is x86_64-only on Linux. Both resolve to the same /usr/local/bin/puppeteer-chrome
# symlink below.
#
# chromium-sandbox is listed EXPLICITLY (not left to Recommends) so --no-install-recommends still
# trims every other Recommends but keeps the setuid sandbox binary available. Our default forces
# --no-sandbox (configuration.ts) so it goes unused, but a user who overrides PUPPETEER_ARGS to drop
# --no-sandbox would otherwise get a chromium that can't launch. Verified on real arm64 hardware:
# with --no-install-recommends the package is dropped, and chromium launches fine under --no-sandbox.

# sqlite3 ships the CLI so an in-container scripts/backup.sh run takes online-consistent SQLite
# snapshots (.backup) instead of plain-copying a live database (which can archive a torn file). The
# DATABASE_TYPE=postgres half of the same script needs pg_dump, installed further down.
#
# ffmpeg backs the opt-in media-conversion endpoints, and also repairs an existing gap: whatsapp-web.js
# requires fluent-ffmpeg at module load and calls it for video-to-webp animated stickers, so
# sendSticker with a video mimetype has been failing in this image for want of the binary. Measured
# cost with --no-install-recommends: ~210 MB, and no new fixable CRITICAL/HIGH findings under the
# release image scan. It is the Debian package rather than a bundled static build precisely so that
# codec CVEs arrive through the same security stream as everything else here.
#
# `apt-get upgrade` runs first because the base is pinned by digest: the Debian packages it ships
# (libpcre2, libc, openssl and the rest) keep that snapshot's versions, and `apt-get install` upgrades
# only the packages it names. A bookworm-security fix published after the snapshot reaches them here,
# and the release workflow rebuilds this layer without cache so the fix is actually picked up.

# The PostgreSQL client for the DATABASE_TYPE=postgres half of backup.sh/restore.sh, which the
# runbook drives in-container. Debian bookworm ships client 15 and pg_dump refuses a newer server
# outright ("aborting because of server version mismatch", reproduced against the postgres:16 the
# bundled compose file runs), so the distro package would install a pg_dump that cannot dump our own
# stack, and psql would be missing for restore. PGDG is PostgreSQL's own apt repository and carries
# current majors for both architectures we build; measured cost ~59 MB.
#
# Deliberately NEWER than the postgres:16 the compose file ships. The rule is one-directional (a
# client may be newer than its server, never older), and DATABASE_HOST often points at a managed
# Postgres the compose file does not control, where 17 is the current default. Pinning to 16 would
# have left every such deployment unable to back up. Verified against live 16 and 17 servers.
#
# The signing key is committed rather than fetched at build time. Fetched, it was the one build input
# nothing pinned: `signed-by` attests only that the .debs match whatever that request returned, so a
# compromised host, or a build behind a TLS-intercepting proxy whose root is in the trust store,
# would swap the trust anchor with nothing to notice. Committed, it is reviewed once and diffable
# forever, and it removes one of the two network calls the release build makes uncached
# (release.yml's `no-cache-filters: production` rebuilds this stage every tag, on both platforms).
# Verify with `gpg --show-keys --with-fingerprint scripts/pgdg-ACCC4CF8.asc`:
#   B97B0AFC AA1A47F0 44F244A0 7FCC7D46 ACCC4CF8, uid "PostgreSQL Debian Repository".
#
# 10 packages arrive with it on top of the list above (12 on a bare base; sqlite3 already brings
# libreadline8), including a full perl interpreter: /usr/bin/pg_dump is a symlink to
# postgresql-common's pg_wrapper, which is a perl script. Trivy on the built image, with the release
# job's own settings (CRITICAL,HIGH + ignore-unfixed + .trivyignore): 0 findings, the bar the ffmpeg
# layer above was held to. Counting unfixed ones too, the perl packages carry 8 CRITICAL/HIGH with
# no upstream fix, but every one of them is a CVE the base image ALREADY had through perl-base
# (Debian essential, present before this layer), so the layer adds 0 distinct vulnerabilities.
# libpq5 and the postgresql-client packages themselves are clean. Recheck with:
#   trivy image --vuln-type os,library --severity CRITICAL,HIGH --ignore-unfixed --ignorefile .trivyignore <image>

# The armored key must reach the image with LF endings. apt dearmors a `signed-by=` .asc through

# repeat this command (scripts/dockerfile-patchers.spec.js fails until they match). It may be newer
# than the revision puppeteer-core pins; the arm64 image already runs whatever chromium Debian ships.
# On an amd64 build, check that a session paired under the old browser still reconnects and that a
# new whatsapp-web.js session reaches its QR code. A new major cannot be rolled back without
# restoring sessions/ (an older Chrome deletes the IndexedDB a newer one opened), so give the bump a
