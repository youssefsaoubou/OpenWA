# @rmyndharis/openwa

Official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for [OpenWA](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA), the open-source WhatsApp API Gateway. OpenWA is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by WhatsApp or Meta.

Ships dual CJS + ESM builds with bundled type declarations.

## Install

```bash
npm install @rmyndharis/openwa
```

Requires Node.js >= 18 (relies on the global `fetch`).

## Usage

```typescript
import { OpenWAClient } from '@rmyndharis/openwa';

const client = new OpenWAClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-gateway.example.com',
  apiKey: 'owa_k1_…',
});

// Sessions are addressed by the UUID that create() returns, not by name. Create a session once;
// afterwards, find its id with client.sessions.list({ name: 'my-session' }).
const session = await client.sessions.create({ name: 'my-session' });
await client.sessions.start(session.id);

// Link the account before sending: scan sessions.getQrCode or use sessions.requestPairingCode,
// then wait for status 'ready'. An unlinked session answers the send with 409.
const result = await client.messages.sendText(session.id, {
  chatId: '628123456789@c.us',
  text: 'Hello from the OpenWA SDK!',
});
console.log(result.messageId);
```

CommonJS consumers use `require('@rmyndharis/openwa')` identically.

## Messaging

> Voice notes: pass `ptt: true` to `sendAudio` to send a real WhatsApp voice note (PTT). Supply `audio/ogg; codecs=opus` audio for reliable playback; the server defaults the mimetype to that when `ptt` is set without one.

## Errors

Non-2xx responses throw a typed `OpenWAApiError` subclass (`OpenWAAuthError`,
`OpenWAForbiddenError`, `OpenWANotFoundError`, `OpenWAConflictError`,
`OpenWARateLimitError`, `OpenWANotImplementedError`,
`OpenWAServiceUnavailableError` for 503), each carrying `.status` and the
parsed `.body`. Timeouts throw `OpenWATimeoutError`. The SDK does **not**
retry — wrap calls with your own backoff if needed. 503 is transient, but a
catalog 503 can persist because WhatsApp may never answer that query, so bound
any retry. A 429 from the global rate limiter lifts when its window expires
(seconds for the per-second tier, up to an hour for the hourly tier by
default), and `.retryAfterSeconds` carries its `Retry-After` header. A 429 whose
`.code` is `"SEND_PACING_LIMITED"` is usually not transient: do not retry it
before `.retryAfterSeconds`, which then comes from the body: a few seconds when
only sends still in flight caused it, the rest of the failure breaker's cooldown
(`SEND_PACING_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS`, 15 minutes by default) after a run of send
failures, otherwise up to the next UTC day. Every API error also exposes the
response `.headers`. A 503 does not prove a write was never carried out: the
engine answers it when WhatsApp did not confirm in time,
and the change may still have been applied, so re-read the state before
repeating it. In a routed deployment a forward that fails before reaching the
owner node answers 503, one that fails after the request reached it answers 502
or 504, and a 503 from the owner itself is relayed unchanged.

## Receiving webhooks

A webhook configured with a secret signs each delivery in its
`X-OpenWA-Signature` header. Check it with `verifyWebhookSignature` against the
raw request body, exactly as received, and parse the JSON only after the check
passes: a re-serialized body can differ byte for byte and will not verify. The
helper resolves `false` (never throws) for a missing, malformed or non-matching
signature. `WebhookDelivery` types the parsed body.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { verifyWebhookSignature, type WebhookDelivery } from '@rmyndharis/openwa';

const app = express();

app.post('/openwa/webhook', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {
  if (!(await verifyWebhookSignature(req.body, req.get('X-OpenWA-Signature'), secret))) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  const delivery = JSON.parse(req.body.toString('utf8')) as WebhookDelivery;
  // Process delivery.event and delivery.data here.
  return res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Releasing

Publishing to npm is done by the
[`js-sdk-release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/js-sdk-release.yml) workflow,
which authenticates with **npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**. There is no npm
token in the workflow or in the repository secrets: npm mints a short-lived
credential from the GitHub OIDC token, and attaches build provenance
automatically. Nothing long-lived exists to leak, expire, or migrate when
2FA-bypass tokens lose direct publish in January 2027.

One-time setup, required **before** the first tag — on npmjs.com, open the
package settings for `@rmyndharis/openwa` and add a Trusted Publisher:

- Provider: **GitHub Actions**
- Organization: `rmyndharis`
- Repository: `OpenWA`
- Workflow filename: `js-sdk-release.yml` (the extension is part of the value)

There are no repository secrets to add. Until the trusted publisher exists npm
rejects the publish, so configure it first.

Cutting a release:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and land it on `main`.
2. Tag that commit `js-sdk-v<version>` (e.g. `js-sdk-v0.5.1`) and push the tag.
   The SDK has its own version line — the monorepo's `v*` tags are the app
   version and never trigger an SDK publish.
3. The workflow re-runs the SDK's tests, typecheck, build and dual CJS/ESM
   smoke check, then publishes. The published tarball is the one those gates
   passed, not a later rebuild.
