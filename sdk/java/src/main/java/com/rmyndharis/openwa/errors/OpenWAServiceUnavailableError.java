/**
 * 503 Service Unavailable — a transport failure, not a refusal.
 *
 * <p>The gateway answers this when the engine did not confirm the operation in time: WhatsApp never
 * replied, the socket was down, or the request budget ran out. <b>Retryable</b>, but a catalog 503
 * can persist because WhatsApp may never answer that query, so bound any retry. The non-idempotent
 * sends are deliberately left unbounded by the gateway so a slow WhatsApp reply never answers one,
 * and in a multi-node deployment a forward that fails before reaching the owner node answers 503. A
 * 503 from the owner itself is relayed unchanged and means the engine did not confirm, so a bounded
 * write such as a group, channel, contact or profile change may still have been applied; re-read
 * the state before repeating it. A forward that fails after the request was sent answers 502 or 504
 * instead (a plain {@link OpenWAApiError}): the owner may already have carried it out, so do not
 * repeat a non-idempotent send on those unchecked.
