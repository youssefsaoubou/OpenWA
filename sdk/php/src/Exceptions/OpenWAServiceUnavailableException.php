/**
 * 503 Service Unavailable — a transport failure, not a refusal.
 *
 * The gateway answers this when the engine did not confirm the operation in time: WhatsApp never
 * replied, the socket was down, or the request budget ran out. Retryable, but a catalog 503 can
 * persist because WhatsApp may never answer that query, so bound any retry. The non-idempotent
 * sends are deliberately left unbounded by the gateway so a slow WhatsApp reply never answers one,
 * and in a multi-node deployment a forward that fails before reaching the owner node answers 503. A
 * 503 from the owner itself is relayed unchanged and means the engine did not confirm, so a bounded
 * write (group, channel, contact or profile change) may still have been applied; re-read the state
 * before repeating it. A forward that fails after the request was sent answers 502 or 504 instead
 * (a plain OpenWAApiException): the owner may already have carried it out, so do not repeat a
 * non-idempotent send on those unchecked.
