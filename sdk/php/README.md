# rmyndharis/openwa

Official PHP SDK for [OpenWA](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA), the open-source WhatsApp API Gateway. OpenWA is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by WhatsApp or Meta.

A synchronous client built on [Guzzle](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/), PSR-4 autoloaded.

## Install

```bash
composer require rmyndharis/openwa
```

Requires PHP 8.1+ and Guzzle 7. The namespace is `OpenWA\`.

## Usage

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use OpenWA\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'baseUrl' => 'https://your-gateway.example.com',
    'apiKey'  => 'owa_k1_…',
]);

// Sessions are addressed by the UUID that create() returns, not by name. Create a session once;
// afterwards, find its id with $client->sessions->list(['name' => 'my-session']).
$session = $client->sessions->create(['name' => 'my-session']);
$client->sessions->start($session['id']);

// Link the account before sending: scan sessions->getQrCode or use sessions->requestPairingCode,
// then wait for status 'ready'. An unlinked session answers the send with 409.
$result = $client->messages->sendText($session['id'], [
    'chatId' => '628123456789@c.us',
    'text'   => 'Hello from the OpenWA PHP SDK!',
]);
echo $result['messageId'];
```

For tests, inject a Guzzle client whose handler is a `MockHandler` — no network, no global state:

```php
$client = new Client([
    'baseUrl'    => 'http://localhost',
    'apiKey'     => 'k',
    'httpClient' => $mockGuzzleClient,
]);
```

## Messaging

> Voice notes: pass `'ptt' => true` to `sendAudio` to send a real WhatsApp voice note (PTT). Supply `audio/ogg; codecs=opus` audio for reliable playback; the server defaults the mimetype to that when `ptt` is set without one.

## Errors

A non-2xx response throws a typed `OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWAApiException` subclass —
`OpenWAAuthException` (401), `OpenWAForbiddenException` (403), `OpenWANotFoundException` (404),
`OpenWAConflictException` (409), `OpenWARateLimitException` (429),
`OpenWANotImplementedException` (501), `OpenWAServiceUnavailableException` (503) — each
exposing `getStatus()` and the parsed `getBody()`. A timeout throws `OpenWATimeoutException`.
503 is transient, but a catalog 503 can persist because WhatsApp may never answer that query,
so bound any retry. A 429 from the global rate limiter lifts when its window expires (seconds for
the per-second tier, up to an hour for the hourly tier by default), and `getRetryAfterSeconds()`
carries its `Retry-After` header. A 429 whose `getErrorCode()` is `"SEND_PACING_LIMITED"` is usually
not transient: do not retry it before `getRetryAfterSeconds()`, which then comes from the body: a
few seconds when only sends still in flight caused it, the rest of the failure breaker's cooldown
(`SEND_PACING_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS`, 15 minutes by default) after a run of send failures, otherwise
up to the next UTC day. `getHeaders()` returns the response headers. A 503 does not prove a write
was never carried out: the engine answers it when WhatsApp did not confirm in time, and the change
may still have been applied, so re-read the state before repeating it. In a routed deployment a
forward that fails before reaching the owner node answers 503, one that fails after the request
reached it answers 502 or 504, and a 503 from the owner itself is relayed unchanged.

```php
use OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWANotFoundException;

try {
    $client->sessions->get('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
} catch (OpenWANotFoundException $e) {
    echo $e->getStatus();  // 404
}
```

## Receiving webhooks

A webhook configured with a secret signs each delivery in its `X-OpenWA-Signature` header. Check it
with `WebhookSignature::verify` against the raw request body, exactly as received, and decode the
JSON only after the check passes: a re-encoded body can differ byte for byte and will not verify.
The helper returns `false` for a missing, malformed or non-matching signature.

```php
use OpenWA\WebhookSignature;

$raw = file_get_contents('php://input');
if (!WebhookSignature::verify($raw, $_SERVER['HTTP_X_OPENWA_SIGNATURE'] ?? null, $secret)) {
    http_response_code(401);
    exit;
}
$delivery = json_decode($raw, true);
// Process $delivery['event'] and $delivery['data'] here.
```

## Notes

- **Use HTTPS in production** — the API key is sent as `X-API-Key` and is bearer-equivalent.
  Over plaintext `http://` to a non-localhost host the client writes a warning with `error_log()`;
  pass `'allowInsecureHttp' => true` to skip it (for example on a private Docker network).
- The SDK does **not** retry, and **never follows redirects** (so the key is never re-sent to
  a redirect target). Path segments are percent-encoded; a base-URL path prefix (e.g. behind a
  reverse proxy) is preserved.
- Escape hatch for endpoints the SDK does not wrap:
  `$client->request($method, $path, $query, $body)`.

## Releasing

Packagist installs this SDK from the mirror repository
[`rmyndharis/openwa-php`](https://github.com/rmyndharis/openwa-php), not from the
monorepo — Composer needs `composer.json` at a repository root and does not
support subdirectories. Two workflows keep that mirror correct:

- [`split-php-sdk.yml`](../../.github/workflows/split-php-sdk.yml) syncs the
  mirror's `main` on every push that touches `sdk/php/**`, which is what
  Packagist's `dev-main` follows.
- [`php-sdk-release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/php-sdk-release.yml) cuts a
  versioned release by pushing a **tag** to the mirror. Packagist derives
  versions from that repository's tags, so a tag in this monorepo alone
  publishes nothing.

There is no `version` field in `composer.json`, and there should not be —
Composer takes the version from the tag, and a hardcoded field drifts. **The tag
is the version.**

Cutting a release:

1. If the minor line changes, update `extra.branch-alias.dev-main` in
   `composer.json` (e.g. `0.1.x-dev` → `0.2.x-dev`) and land it on `main`. The
   release workflow refuses to publish when the alias does not match the tag.
2. Tag that commit `php-sdk-v<version>` (e.g. `php-sdk-v0.5.1`) and push the
   tag. The SDK has its own version line — the monorepo's `v*` tags are the app
   version and never trigger an SDK release.
3. The workflow runs the test suite, then tags the mirror `<version>` (no `v`
   prefix, matching the existing tags there). Packagist picks it up from its
   GitHub hook within a minute or two.

> **A released version is effectively immutable.** Packagist caches a tag's
> contents, so moving one does not reliably reach anyone who already resolved
> it. The workflow refuses to overwrite an existing mirror tag — bump the
> version instead of re-tagging.

Requires the `PHP_SDK_SPLIT_TOKEN` secret, the same one the mirror workflow
uses. Unlike the mirror workflow, which skips with a notice when the token is
absent, the release **fails**: a release that silently publishes nothing looks
exactly like one that worked.
