/**
 * The ingress route's pre-authentication rate bound, keyed on the client IP.
 *
 * The route is `@Public`, so this is the only bound on traffic that has not proven anything yet:
 * unknown instances, failed challenges, oversized bodies and bad signatures. The per-instance bound
 * that keeps one noisy tenant from starving the others on a provider's shared egress IP is charged
 * by IngressService only once a delivery's signature verifies (see admitIngressInstance).
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT use `@Throttle()` to size its limit: `@Throttle` metadata is reflected on
 * the route/handler and is read by EVERY `ThrottlerGuard` instance that walks a tier of that name,
 * including the global per-IP guard, which shares the `short`/`medium`/`long` tier list from the one
 * process-wide `ThrottlerModule.forRootAsync` config. Overriding one of those tiers here would silently
 * retarget the global guard's tolerance for this route too. Instead, `onModuleInit` below replaces
 * `this.throttlers` with its own tier that only this guard instance evaluates.
