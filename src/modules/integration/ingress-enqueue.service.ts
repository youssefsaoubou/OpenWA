 * '0:'-prefixed id ("JobId cannot be '0' or start with '0:'"). Providers send numeric dedup headers
 * (`svix-Id: 12345`), and the redrive path mints `redrive:<uuid>`, so these refusals happen in
 * practice, and because enqueue()'s catch-all treats ANY add() throw as "Redis unreachable", the job
 * silently degraded to inline dispatch with no retry, no backoff, and a blocked redrive loop. Every id
 * therefore maps to a deterministic sha256 prefix, which BullMQ always accepts: its exactly-once dedup
 * only needs the id STABLE per delivery, not recognizable, and the reconciler replays through this
 * same function so its dedup against an earlier enqueue is preserved.
 *
 * The hash input is namespaced with the plugin/instance pair, for EVERY id rather than only the
 * refused shapes. BullMQ dedups jobIds across the WHOLE shared ingress queue, while the database dedup
 * is (pluginId, instanceId, providerDeliveryId), and two instances can share a provider id: numeric
 * per-account sequences, or one Standard Webhooks message fanned out to two endpoints with the same
 * `webhook-id`. Without the namespace, the second instance's delivery would collide with the first's
 * job id and BullMQ would silently discard it (resolved as the existing job, no DLQ row); with it, the
 * queue-level dedup matches the database-level scope. A non-string id (a duplicated header can surface
 * as string[]) is coerced rather than trusted to reach BullMQ's own checks.
