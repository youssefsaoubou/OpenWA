// @Public so the global ApiKeyGuard early-returns (providers can't present an API key). The
// controller-level @SkipThrottle below exempts the GLOBAL per-IP guard (see its comment).
// The provider body is read as RAW bytes from req.rawBody (stashed by the json() verify callback in
// src/configure-app.ts) — it is intentionally NOT DTO-bound, so the global ValidationPipe never 400s on the
// provider's unknown keys, and the exact signed bytes reach the HMAC verifier.

// The global per-IP throttle SKIPS this route (its medium tier, 100/min by default, sits below the
// per-instance limit's 120/min, so a provider delivering every tenant's webhooks from one shared
// egress IP was 429'd at the IP tier before the instance bound ever fired). InstanceThrottlerGuard
// bounds each client instead, and IngressService charges a per-(pluginId, instanceId) bucket once a
// delivery's signature verifies. The client tier counts every request, including one the instance
// bucket then sheds, so a tenant pushing one shared IP past INGRESS_IP_LIMIT sheds its neighbours too.

  //
  // Two rate bounds, neither from the global per-IP guard (skipped via @SkipThrottle above, because
  // its medium tier of 100/min sits below the per-instance default of 120/min and 429'd every
  // tenant of a shared-egress-IP provider). InstanceThrottlerGuard ignores the bare @SkipThrottle
  // (see its shouldSkip) and bounds each client IP before anything else (INGRESS_IP_LIMIT). The
  // per-(pluginId, instanceId) bucket (INGRESS_INSTANCE_LIMIT) is charged by IngressService only
  // after the signature verifies. Both windows use INGRESS_INSTANCE_TTL. The limits are read from the
  // environment, NOT via @Throttle: @Throttle metadata is reflected on the route and read by every
