 * Two rules, both aimed at the way WhatsApp actually bans automated accounts:

 *  - a **warm-up daily cap**, because a new account that immediately sends at volume is the pattern
 *    that gets numbers banned. The allowance grows with the session's age.
 *  - a **failure-streak breaker**, because a run of consecutive send failures usually means WhatsApp
 *    has already started refusing this account, and continuing to push makes its standing worse.
 *
 * It is plain code called from the send paths, NOT a `message:sending` hook subscriber. That is
 * load-bearing: `runGuarded` (plugin-capability-context.ts) suppresses `message:sending` when a
 * plugin sends from inside its own handler, so a hook-based governor would be silently bypassed on
 * exactly the automated traffic it exists to pace.
 *
 * The daily count is read from the `messages` table rather than a counter of its own. That table is
 * already the durable record of every chat send — bulk included, which persists through the same
 * `saveOutgoingMessage` — and it already carries the `(sessionId, createdAt)` index the count needs.
 * So the cap survives restarts with no table and no migration. The trade is that it counts only what
 * writes a row. Two kinds of path clear this check without ever adding to it: a status post
 * (status.service.ts) and a message edit, which is gated here via applySendingGate but only UPDATEs
 * the existing row, never inserts. A bulk item the engine refuses is a third: bulk persists its row only
 * after the send succeeds, so a failed item is checked against the cap but never counted into it,
 * unlike a failed single send whose PENDING row is kept as FAILED. A session using
 * them can exceed its stated allowance. A Baileys product send (catalog.service.ts `sendProduct`)
 * writes no row itself but is counted through the OUTGOING row its own-send echo persists
 * (MessageProjector.handleOwnSendEcho) shortly after the send returns. Deliberate, and documented in
 * .env.example and docs/06 so the number an operator reads is the number they get.
 * Because the row lands only after the check returns, sends admitted in the last few seconds are
 * also held in memory (see Admission), or a parallel burst would pass against one stale count. A bulk
 * item and a product send write their row only after the engine call, which can outlast that window
 * (a media URL fetch, an upload), so they are held until they settle (see `untilSettled`).
 * The breaker, by contrast, is in memory on purpose: it describes live conditions, and a restart
 * clearing it is the correct behaviour.
