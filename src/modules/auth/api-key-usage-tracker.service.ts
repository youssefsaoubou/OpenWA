/**
 * Coalesced usage statistics for API keys: `usageCount` and `lastUsedAt`.
 *
 * These are advisory — authentication never reads them — but they are written on the per-request
 * authentication hot path, so a naive implementation costs one DB write per request. The accumulator
 * below collapses that to at most one write per key per window, keeping the returned entity accurate
 * by adding the not-yet-persisted deltas to the value it hands back.
 *
 * It lives outside AuthService because the pending map was the one piece of state shared between
 * three otherwise-unrelated concerns: the authN hot path that increments it, admin key lifecycle that
 * drops a deleted or revoked key's counters, and shutdown that flushes what is left. None of those
 * change for the same reason.
