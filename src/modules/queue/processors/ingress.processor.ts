// taken inside the job, though, so a job waiting on a busy key still holds a worker slot. A burst on
// one key larger than the concurrency fills every slot with waiters, and other keys queue behind it
// until it drains. The key is per instance when the route declares no conversationId pointer, so
// routes should declare one, and the concurrency should exceed the largest expected per-key burst.
//
// Strict end-to-end order is NOT preserved across a BullMQ retry: a retried job re-enters lock.run()
// after its backoff and chains at the conversation's CURRENT tail, so it can overtake a
// same-conversation successor that dispatched
// during the backoff window. This is a deliberate tradeoff — BullMQ retries release the worker slot
// during backoff (better throughput under transient failure), where retrying inside the lock would
// hold it — and is acceptable because ingress order is best-effort regardless: the provider delivers
// over unordered HTTP. Order-strict plugins must not assume retry-involved events arrive in sequence.
