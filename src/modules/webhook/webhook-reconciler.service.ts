 * Closes the crash window on outbound webhook delivery.
 *
 * Fan-out is fire-and-forget from the projector, so before the outbox row existed a hard crash
 * between persisting a message and completing its POST lost the delivery with nothing left behind
 * in either mode, while the documented contract promises at-least-once. The row makes the intent
 * durable; this sweep is what turns durability into delivery.
 *
 * Mirrors IngressReconcilerService on the inbound side: an unref'd interval started on module init,
 * an overlap guard so a slow pass never stacks, a bounded batch, and a per-row replay budget.
 *
 * The sweep does NOT claim a row, so two nodes running against one database can both replay the
 * same delivery. That is deliberate and matches the inbound reconciler: the replay carries the
 * stored idempotency key, which is exactly the header a receiver dedups on, so the cost of the
 * race is a duplicate the contract already tells consumers to expect. Claiming would trade that
 * for a lock whose holder can die mid-flight.
