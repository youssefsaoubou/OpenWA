// The dispatch lifecycle of one outbound delivery, mirroring ingress_events on the inbound side:
//  - 'pending'    - the row was written before the attempt; nothing durable owns the delivery yet.
//                   The reconciler sweeps these.
//  - 'dispatched' - the delivery reached a durable owner: handed to BullMQ, or completed inline in
//                   direct mode. A failure INSIDE that owner dead-letters separately through
//                   webhook_delivery_failures, so a 'dispatched' row is never the reconciler's
//                   concern. Retiring on ENQUEUE rather than on the POST is what stops the
//                   reconciler duplicating work BullMQ already owns.
//  - 'failed'     - terminal, set only by the reconciler: either the replay budget is spent
//                   (recovery continues through the failure row), or the webhook was removed,
//                   disabled or unsubscribed from the event before a replay (no failure row;
//                   nothing to recover). The gated direct path closes that second case as
//                   'dispatched' instead.
// NULL marks rows that predate these columns on a synchronize-bootstrapped database. NULL reads as
// "not watched", so an upgrade can never mass-replay history.

/**
 * Durable record of an outbound webhook delivery, written before the attempt.
 *
 * Fan-out is fire-and-forget from the projector (`void dispatch(...)`), so until this row existed a
 * hard crash between persisting a message and completing its POST lost the delivery with nothing
 * left behind in either mode. The in-memory `inFlightDeliveries` map already tracked exactly this
 * set; the row is its durable twin.
 *
 * UNIQUE(webhookId, idempotencyKey): the key is already salted per webhook at dispatch, so the pair
 * names one delivery attempt-set exactly, and a replay reuses the STORED key rather than deriving a
 * new one, which is what keeps a redelivery deduplicable at the receiver.
