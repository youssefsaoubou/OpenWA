   * Shared disconnect handling for BOTH the engine's onDisconnected callback and the liveness

   * reconnect. The session row is re-read here rather than trusting a caller-held snapshot — the
   * watchdog detects death long after the last state change, and even the callback's closure
   * snapshot can be stale — so the reconnect always re-initializes from the current row. Never
   * throws: a DB hiccup must not turn a disconnect into an unhandled rejection.
   *
   * Concurrency fence: the caller has already gated entry on `isLiveEngine(id, engine)` against
   * the synchronous-callback window, but this handler awaits a DB read and (later) schedules work
   * off a captured `session` snapshot. Between the entry check and the awaits an id can be
   * reassigned — a stop()/reconnect that replaces the engine mid-flight — so the captured engine
   * is treated as an object-identity generation token: every observable side effect and the
   * reconnect scheduling are gated on `engine` STILL being the live owner at the point they run.
   * A stale disconnect handler must not publish disconnect side effects for a session that now
   * belongs to a different engine, nor schedule a reconnect whose timer would later destroy the
   * replacement engine.
