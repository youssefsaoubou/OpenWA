   * Log out of WhatsApp — attempts an engine-native unlink of this device, then tears the session

   *
   * Differs from stop() in the one way that matters to a user: logout() asks WhatsApp to remove the
   * companion device, so a completed unlink eventually makes the entry disappear from the account
   * holder's Linked Devices list. stop() and delete() only release things locally (delete also
   * purges the on-disk auth dirs).
   *
   * Completion (HTTP 200) means the engine-native unlink operation completed AND the required local
   * credential cleanup completed — for Baileys, a valid companion identity, an acknowledged
   * `remove-companion-device` IQ response, and removal of the on-disk auth dir; for whatsapp-web.js,
   * `Client.logout()` including `LocalAuth.logout()` settled. 200 is NOT an independent observation
   * that the handset UI no longer shows the linked device — only the linked-device canary observes
   * that, and the dashboard must not claim otherwise.
   *
   * Must run while the engine is still live — logout is a network round-trip to WhatsApp, so it
   * cannot be performed after destroy()/forceDestroy(). Mirrors stop()'s lifecycle otherwise
   * (stop-mark + cancel-reconnect + bounded, isolated teardown + Map reconciliation).
   *
   * Requires a started session: with no engine loaded there is nothing to send the unlink through,
   * so the request is rejected with 400 rather than reporting an unlink that never happened. A 400
   * does NOT change the row. To just release a stopped session locally, use stop()/delete().
   *
   * Throws a retryable BadGatewayException (502) carrying a stable `code: 'SESSION_LOGOUT_INCOMPLETE'`
   * when an accepted engine-backed attempt stopped locally but the unlink operation did NOT complete
   * — no identity/no send, no IQ acknowledgement, timeout/transport error, OR local credential
