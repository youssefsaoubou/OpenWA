 * it marks a session an operator must look at, and silently relocating it would hide that.
 *
 * DISCONNECTED is present, so the status correction must never write it over a row this sweep would
 * otherwise leave alone: markLapsedDisconnected corrects READY, INITIALIZING, AUTHENTICATING and
 * ACTION_REQUIRED, which are adopted either way, and QR_READY only on a row with no phone, which

 * row is corrected more than three TTLs after that renewal, plus up to one sweep interval.

 * sat disconnected until someone called POST /start). This sweep is the retry: every tick it looks
 * for lapsed-lease sessions and starts them here through the ordinary start path, so the claim
 * stays race-safe against peers doing the same.
