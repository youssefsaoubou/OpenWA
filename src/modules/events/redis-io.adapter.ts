/**
 * A Socket.IO server whose broadcasts reach clients connected to OTHER replicas, via the Redis
 * pub/sub adapter.
 *
 * The gateway already broadcasts to rooms (`server.to(room).emit(...)`); the default in-memory
 * adapter only reaches sockets on THIS process, so a client connected to replica A never sees an
 * event raised on replica B. Attaching the Redis adapter on the root `io` — before any namespace
 * is used — makes every namespace, including `/events`, fan its room broadcasts out through Redis.
 * No emit site changes.
 *
 * SCOPE (honest): this distributes event FAN-OUT only. Key eviction (`socketsByKeyId`), the WS
 * rate-limit buckets, and the engine registry remain process-local — a key revoked on replica A
 * still tears down only A's sockets, and per-key WS limits are counted per replica. See
 * docs/13-horizontal-scaling.md.
 *
 * Failure posture: if the pub/sub clients cannot be created the server falls back to the in-memory
 * adapter — the local node keeps working, only cross-node fan-out is lost — rather than refusing to
 * boot. A Redis outage, at boot or after it, is ioredis's problem to retry; the adapter recovers on reconnect.
