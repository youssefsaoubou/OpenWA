 * The state no other spec constructs: a database whose `messages` rows predate the FTS schema, with
 * the migration NOT applied.
 *
 * `builtin-fts.provider.spec.ts`, `search-dual-db.spec.ts` and `test/search.e2e-spec.ts` all run
 * `AddMessagesFts…up()` first, so the index is always populated by the migration's own backfill and
 * the provider's backfill branch never executes. That is why this shipped and survived: the branch
 * has no coverage, not weak coverage.
 *
 * `messages_fts` is an FTS5 **external-content** table, so `count(*)` on it scans `messages` and
 * returns that table's row count rather than the number of indexed documents. The document count
 * lives in the `messages_fts_docsize` shadow table. Every assertion here is written against
 * behaviour — what `search()` can find — with `docsize` used only to describe the fixture.
