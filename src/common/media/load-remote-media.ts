/**
 * Fetch remote media as a Buffer for sending, with an SSRF host guard, a byte cap, and a timeout.
 * The guard runs BEFORE any network call, so an internal/reserved URL throws `SsrfBlockedError`
 * and no outbound socket is opened. It goes through `withSafeFetch`, which pins a direct or SOCKS
 * connection to the vetted IP (an HTTP/HTTPS session proxy resolves the name itself, so nothing is
 * pinned there) and refuses redirects (the guard only validated the original host — a followed 3xx
 * could reach an internal target). The cap is enforced while streaming (Content-Length may be absent
 * or wrong) to bound memory use.
 *
 * Engine-neutral: returns raw bytes + the response content-type, so any engine adapter can use it.
 *
 * A URL that cannot be fetched is the caller's input, not an engine fault: a non-2xx answer, a
 * missing body, a timeout or a failed connection throw `BadRequestException`, and a body over the
 * cap throws `PayloadTooLargeException`. As plain Errors they left every send path as a 500 and
 * counted toward the send-pacing breaker. `SsrfBlockedError` is rethrown unchanged; each caller maps
 * it to its own generic message.
 *
 * Behind a session proxy a failed connection or a timeout before any response is answered 503
 * instead: undici reports a proxy that refuses, cannot be resolved or fails its handshake with the
 * same `fetch failed` as an unreachable target, so the two cannot be told apart, and blaming the
 * caller's URL for an operator's proxy outage would send the client to fix a link that works. Once a
 * response has arrived the target was reached, and its failures stay 400/413. The 503 is an
 * `EngineNotSentError`: the fetch runs before WhatsApp is asked, so a paced send gives its admission
 * back.
 *
 * `sessionProxyUrl` is the egress proxy of the session the fetch is attributed to, or undefined for
 * a direct one. It is required rather than optional so a new call site cannot leave a proxied
 * session's fetch going direct by omission; `urlFetchProxy` applies the operator's opt-out.
