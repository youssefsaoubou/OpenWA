/**
 * `docs/06-api-specification.md` is the reference a REST consumer reads when there is no SDK — curl,
 * Postman, n8n. It restates the published contract by hand, and nothing bound the two, so operations
 * shipped without ever reaching it: `GET`/`PATCH /api/sessions/{id}/config` are implemented by all
 * five SDKs and documented only in `docs/05`, and the integration redrive route was documented
 * nowhere at all.
 *
 * This gate compares the document's route headings to `openapi.json` in both directions. An
 * operation added without a heading, a heading left behind after a route is renamed, and a stale
 * allowlist entry all fail here.
 *
 * Operations deliberately documented in another file carry an allowlist entry naming that file, and
 * the gate reads the file to confirm the path is really there — otherwise "documented in docs/25"
 * would be an unchecked claim, which is the exact failure this gate exists to prevent.
