   * Bound one capability call host-side. On timeout the caller (the worker) gets an error cap-result
   * and the in-flight slot frees, so a plugin whose calls hang can't wedge all maxInFlightCaps slots
   * into a self-DoS. The underlying host-side work is NOT cancelled — host verbs hold no cancellation
   * token — so when it eventually settles the outcome is only logged as a WARN and its result is
   * discarded (never a second cap-result). This is a robustness bound, not an atomicity guarantee: a
   * timed-out call may still complete its side effect late (e.g. a message send that lands after the
   * caller already saw the timeout error). To keep that late-settle window small where a duplicate is
   * user-visible, send verbs (SEND_CAP_VERBS) run on a wider budget that covers normal execution.
