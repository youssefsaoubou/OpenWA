 * 1. `execution context was destroyed` — Puppeteer disposed the isolated world while an `evaluate`
 *    was still waiting for a context, i.e. the page went away underneath it.
 * 2. `window.require is not a function` — the navigation landed on a page whose WhatsApp Web bundle
 *    has not defined its module registry yet, so the evaluate reaches `window.require` before it
 *    exists. Observed at the first boot after the pinned WA Web build moved under a warm profile:
 *    twice, then the session reached READY unaided, and a restart on the same build produced none.
 *
 * Only the FIRST alternative mirrors the whatsapp-web.js adapter's `isExecutionContextDestroyedError`
 * — deliberately duplicated rather than imported, because that module pulls whatsapp-web.js in eagerly
 * and this one loads during bootstrap, where the engine must stay lazy. Keep that alternative in sync
 * with it. The second is monitor-only ON PURPOSE: the adapter uses its predicate to advise about a
 * stale browser profile (#663/#708), and a missing `window.require` is not evidence of that, so
 * teaching it there would produce a confidently wrong advisory.

 * container's restart policy still fires and we never continue running on corrupted post-exception
 * in-memory state (the `engines`/`reconnectStates`/limiter maps could be mid-mutation) — we only add
 * the fatal stack to the log pipeline, which `console.error`-to-stderr misses.
 *
 * The body is guarded so a throw inside the monitor (a poisoned error whose `.stack` getter throws, a
 * `String()`-incompatible value, or a downed logger) can never mask the original fatal error or change
 * the exit code — the worst case degrades to losing this one log line while Node's default print + exit

 *
 * One class is logged at WARN instead of ERROR: a Puppeteer rejection left behind when the page an
 * `evaluate` was waiting on goes away. whatsapp-web.js re-runs `inject()` from an async
 * `framenavigated` listener it never awaits, so a page navigation or an engine teardown turns that
 * still-pending evaluate into a rejection with no owner (#982). Either way the session recovers on its
 * own, and an ERROR with a raw Puppeteer stack reads like a crash.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped so nothing actionable is muted: the ACTIONABLE variant of the same message — a
 * browser profile left stale by an upgrade that changed the Chromium binary (#663/#708) — is thrown
 * from inside `engine.initialize()`, where the adapter catches it and logs its own advisory, so it
 * never reaches this handler. And only the severity changes: the full reason is still logged.
