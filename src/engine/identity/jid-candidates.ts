/**
 * Engine-neutral expansion of a WhatsApp JID into every form of the same entity (shared by the
 * message chat filter and the API-key chat scope, so the two cannot disagree about identity).
 *
 * - a `<phone>@c.us` / `@s.whatsapp.net` input yields the literal, both user dialects, and every lid
 *   the directory maps to that phone;
 * - a `<lid>@lid` input yields the literal and the phone it resolves to (in both user dialects). It
 *   deliberately does NOT mint `<lid-digits>@c.us`: a lid's digits are not a phone number, and
 *   treating them as one would let `555000111@lid` match a `555000111@c.us` chat.
 * - a group / status / newsletter / broadcast id has exactly one stored form, so it yields only the
 *   literal (expanding a group's digits into the user dialects could match an unrelated person), and
 *   so does an id under an unrecognised domain; only a bare number is qualified as a phone.
 *
 * The last rule is why a non-user kind returns just the input: it fails closed on the literal id.
