 * it, so answering it would have a retrying caller publish the status twice.
 *
 * ./baileys-channels leaves `createChannel` unbounded on the same reasoning, and the message sends
 * keep their `500` rather than a replayable `503`. Use {@link withPage} for reads and for
 * operations that converge when repeated, including DELETE.
