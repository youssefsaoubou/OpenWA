 * WA error code of a SERVER-refused Baileys query, or undefined for a transport/local failure.

 * A numeric `data` is the whole discriminator, and it is sufficient: `query()` runs
 * `assertNodeErrorFree(result)` before it returns (Socket/socket.js:133-135), and that throws
 * `new Boom(text, { data: +errNode.attrs.code })` (WABinary/generic-utils.js:57). So every refusal
 * that can reach a caller through `query()` already carries its WA code as a number.
 *
 * There used to be a second branch reading `output.statusCode` whenever `data !== undefined`,
 * meant for `extractGroupMetadata`'s error-node throw (Socket/groups.js). It did the opposite of
 * its purpose: Boom's constructor destructures `data = null` (@hapi/boom lib/index.js:77), so NO
 * Boom ever has `data === undefined` and the guard was always true. Every transport Boom therefore
 * matched — `Boom('Connection Closed', { statusCode: 428 })` returned 428, inside the 4xx window,
 * so a dead socket was reported as `403 admin rights or permissions may be missing`. The branch was
 * also unnecessary: its target throw cannot be reached through `query()`, because a result carrying
 * an `<error>` child has already thrown from assertNodeErrorFree's identical lookup.
 *
 * Only the IQ error channel is decoded here. WhatsApp's w:mex surface reports a refusal as a
 * GraphQL error inside a SUCCESSFUL iq, which never passes through assertNodeErrorFree and carries
 * an object rather than a numeric `data` — see wmexRefusalCode in baileys-channels.ts. Widening this
 * function to accept an object `data` would also swallow promiseTimeout's Boom, which carries
 * `{ stack }` alongside a 4xx DisconnectReason code, so the two channels stay separate.
