// e2e boot environment. Set BEFORE AppModule is imported (setupFiles phase) so the
// app boots against local SQLite with no Redis/queue and no production boot guard.
//
// These suites run ONE AT A TIME (`maxWorkers: 1` in jest-e2e.json). That began as a fix for
// parallel workers fighting over one plugin registry, and the measurement below records it. Serial
// execution did not close the whole hole: the registry was shared SEQUENTIALLY too. Each suite
// boots a real application, and closing it disables every enabled plugin, which writes
// `status: disabled` into the registry the NEXT suite then boots against. Measured directly:
// set the whatsapp-web.js engine to `enabled`, run one AppModule-booting suite, and it comes back
// `disabled`. The same write landed in the DEVELOPER's `./data/plugins/registry.json`.
// PLUGIN_STATE_DIR below redirects it, the way the databases and the key file are redirected.
// Measured on one parallel run: 52 writes from 12 processes, 30 of them landing within 500ms of a
// write by a different process. Each individual write is atomic, but the read-modify-write cycle
// is not, so workers overwrote and re-read each other's plugin state.
//
// The result was a roughly one-in-ten failure that moved between suites — a 403 where a 200 was
// expected, a 404 where a 403 was, a rate-limit window behaving oddly — and never reproduced when a
// suite was run on its own, which is what made it read as flakiness. Serially it does not happen:
// 11 consecutive clean runs against a measured failure rate of about one in twelve in parallel.
//
// Restoring parallelism means giving each worker its own data root, not just its own database.

// Put every suite's server on a LOOPBACK port before supertest can start one of its own.
//
// supertest starts a server per request with `listen(0)` and no host (supertest/lib/test.js), which
// binds the wildcard address, and then dials `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` whatever it bound. macOS hands
// out an ephemeral port that an unrelated process already holds on 127.0.0.1 specifically (measured:
// 40 of 40 such ports went to a wildcard listener), permits the overlapping bind, and routes the
// loopback connection to the MORE specific binding. That process then answers, and its status reaches
// the assertion: a captured run took a `501 Not Implemented` from a desktop helper on 127.0.0.1:49657,
// on a machine holding 29 such loopback listeners. That is where this lane's statuses with no matching
// route came from, on a different test each run, and no amount of state isolation could reach it.
//
// The host cannot simply be added to that `listen` call: a host argument routes the bind through
// dns.lookup, so it completes a tick later, and supertest reads `address().port` synchronously.
// Listening here instead means `app.address()` is already set, so supertest reuses this server and
// never opens one. Binding 127.0.0.1 also makes a collision a refused bind rather than a silent
// share, and the allocator skips ports already held on that address.
//
// Boundary worth knowing: this patches a prototype, so a suite that booted an app inside
// `jest.isolateModules` would get a fresh, unpatched `@nestjs/core` and fall back to the exposed
// path. Nothing does that today (the one caller only reads module metadata), but a new one would
// need to listen on loopback itself.
