/**
 * The listening contract setup-e2e.ts enforces, and the reason it exists.
 *
 * supertest starts a server per request with `listen(0)` and no host, which binds the wildcard
 * address, and then dials 127.0.0.1 regardless of what it bound. macOS hands a wildcard listener an
 * ephemeral port another process already holds on 127.0.0.1 specifically, allows the overlapping bind,
 * and routes the loopback connection to the more specific binding, so that process answers instead of
 * the app. The lane saw this as statuses no route can return, on a different test each run.
 *
 * setup-e2e.ts closes it by listening on 127.0.0.1 during `init()`, which is also the condition
 * supertest branches on: a server that already has an address is reused rather than replaced. Both
 * halves are asserted, because either one alone can hold while the protection is gone. Listening on
 * the wildcard address still satisfies the second test, and never listening at all still satisfies
 * neither, so the pair fails on a different side depending on which half was lost.
 *
 * The last two cover what taking that port early costs elsewhere: a bind that fails has to be
 * reported rather than stall the boot, and an app that goes on to call `listen()` has to get its own
 * socket back.
